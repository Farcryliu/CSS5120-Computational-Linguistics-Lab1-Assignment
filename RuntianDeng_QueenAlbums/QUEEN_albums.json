        "summary": "A Day at the Races is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 10 December 1976 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Recorded at The Manor, Sarm East, and Wessex Sound Studios in England, it was the band's first completely self-produced album, and the first completed without the involvement of producer Roy Thomas Baker; engineering duties were handled by Mike Stone. It serves as a companion to Queen's previous album, A Night at the Opera, with both taking their names from Marx Brothers films and having similar packaging and eclectic musical themes.\nThe album reached the top of the charts in the UK, Japan, and the Netherlands. It reached number five on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart and was Queen's third album to ship gold in the US, subsequently reaching platinum status in the country. In 2006, a listener poll conducted by BBC Radio 2 saw A Day at the Races voted the 67th greatest album of all time.",

                "content": "On 25 April 1976, the band settled back in London after a four-leg, six-month, and exhaustive tour of their highly successful album A Night at the Opera, recorded during the oppressive summer of 1975; the band decided to take a two-month hiatus. They only occasionally did business-related activities (such as filming the promotional video for \"You're My Best Friend\" in late April). During June, the band was beginning to plan out the recording sessions for the album, visiting recording studios around Greater London to determine where they would produce the album. On 15 June, Roger Taylor and John Deacon visited Sweet Silence Studios in Denmark. The studio was completed only two months prior.\nAfter Taylor and Deacon returned from Denmark, rehearsals began on 17 June at Ridge Farm Studio, where the band had rehearsed for their previous album in July 1975. Due to equipment issues during the first week, the band hired Pete Cornish on 25 June to assist in equipment maintenance. Cornish and the band had previous involvement, as his company had helped repair and construct new equipment for the band in January 1972.",

                "content": "Queen entered The Manor in Oxfordshire on 12 July to commence work on A Day at the Races. Absent was Roy Thomas Baker, who had helped the band produce their last four albums. The four-album contract he had signed with the band in 1972 had expired after the release of the band's fourth album, and the band had decided to record the album by themselves, with the assistance of engineers Mike Stone and Gary Langan.\nBy late July, the band had finished 6 songs: \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\", \"The Millionaire Waltz\", \"You Take My Breath Away\", \"White Man\" (then titled \"Simple Man\"), \"Drowse\", and a shorter version of \"Somebody to Love\". As August entered, the band worked on the remaining songs of the album, and finished a longer version of \"Somebody to Love\". Work was relaxed, and the band sometimes played billiards or card games during productive days. During a game of billiards on 8 August, between Roger and one of the band's roadies, Crystal Taylor, Roger asked him to be his personal roadie, to which Crystal assented.\nThe band had booked to play two concerts on 20 and 21 August at the Playhouse Theatre in Edinburgh, and the band said to Melody Maker they would be debuting new material during those concerts. The band eventually cancelled those concerts since the songs they wanted to debut weren't finished, and instead did a mini-tour of the country during September. The band had at least the backing tracks of \"Tie Your Mother Down\" (likely the overdubbed product), \"Long Away\", \"You and I\", and \"Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\" recorded by 24 August, including the previously recorded material, before the band began to rehearse for their summer mini-tour the following day.\nThe summer tour started in Edinburgh, where \"Tie Your Mother Down\", and \"You Take My Breath Away\" were debuted to the audience. During the summer tour, the band moved production into Sarm East Studios and worked there sporadically in between concerts (in approximately nine sessions) between 5 and 16 September to do overdubs. During this period predominantly guitar overdubs were added to \"The Millionaire Waltz\". Most of the songs that were initially recorded in July were finished off during this time, and the rest of the songs recorded in August that weren't performed live were put off until work on the album properly resumed.\nRecording sessions resumed on 20 September at Sarm, with more overdubs and rough mixing of some of the finished tracks. On 23 September, the band published a thank you message in the music press to their fans regarding their warm response to their concert at Hyde Park on 18 September (the final date of the summer tour). \"Tie Your Mother Down\" was mostly mixed on 26 September, and a mix of \"Long Away\" was worked on during the same day. The band completed a preliminary mix of \"Somebody to Love\" on 29 September.\nThe band turned their attention to the lead single during mid-October, which was scheduled to be released in three weeks. They mixed the single from 18 to 24 October. \"Somebody to Love\", which was recorded in two separate parts, was mixed first. Parts 1 and 2 were fused together and completed on 22 October. They then turned their attention to \"White Man\", which was mostly mixed on 23 October and finished on 24 October. The band then moved to Wessex Sound Studios on 25 October to begin mixing the rest of the album. On 26 October, \"Long Away\" and \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" were mixed. On 28 October, while mixing tracks off of the album, the band were taken into a different room at Wessex to partake in a photoshoot. The photos from this shoot ended up on the inner sleeve of the album.\nPressure to complete the album was becoming more apparent, as the due date was coming close. After a day off at the end of the month, work immediately resumed. On 1 November, \"You Take My Breath Away\" was mixed, and finished off the following day. A tape of the still unfinished album was created on 5 November, with a different track-list and a lot of chatter and studio noise clearly not mixed out of some songs yet. \"Teo Torriatte\" wasn't even completed at this point, with some crucial overdubs still to be done. On 9 November, \"Long Away\", \"Drowse\", and \"Tie Your Mother Down\" were fully mixed at Wessex. These songs had been worked on during the previous three days.\nOn 16 November, \"The Millionaire Waltz\" and \"You and I\" were mixed at Wessex. On 17 and 18 November, \"Teo Torriatte\" was mixed at Wessex, and the album was mastered on 19 November, officially completing it. A pressing of the album was played to fans and music press at Advision Studios on 26 November. The album took approximately 16 weeks in total to record, the longest time the band had spent recording an album yet.",

At the time, he was working on his PhD in Astronomy. He wrote the song on Spanish guitar and thought he'd change the title and chorus later on, but when he brought it to the band for inclusion on this album, Freddie Mercury liked the original and it was kept the way it was written.\nThe song is preceded by an instrumental introduction consisting of a multi-tracked guitar part, reminiscent of the song \"White Man\", followed by a Shepard tone figure, which is reprised at the end of \"Teo Torriatte\" to create a \"circle\" in the album. The ascending scale of the second part of the intro was created by reversing a recording of a descending scale played on a harmonium.\nThe main bulk of the song can be described as heavy blues rock, featuring aggressive vocals by lead singer Mercury, as well as a slide guitar solo by May, who provided most of the backing vocals.\nA music video was made for the song, directed by Bruce Gowers and based on a performance clip shot at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York, in February 1977 during the band's US arena headlining tour. After its release in 1976, the song was played by Queen on every subsequent tour.",

It has two choruses sung in Japanese, making it one of only three Queen songs in which an entire verse or chorus is sung in a language other than English (the others being \"Mustapha\", from Jazz and \"Las Palabras de Amor\" from Hot Space). The song features a piano, a plastic piano, and a harmonium, all of which are played by May.\nThe harmonium melody that ends the song is a longer reprise of the second part of the introduction to \"Tie Your Mother Down\", the first track on the album.

The Washington Post described it as \"a judicious blend of heavy metal rockers and classically influenced, almost operatic, torch songs.\" The Winnipeg Free Press was also appreciative, writing: \"Races is a reconfirmation of Queen's position as the best of the third wave of English rock groups.\" Circus gave the album a mixed review, writing: \"With A Day at the Races, they've deserted art-rock entirely. They're silly now. And wondrously shameless.\"\nHowever, retrospective reviews have been positive and more appreciative of the album. Greg Kot, reviewing for Chicago Tribune gave the album a very positive rating that matched the exact rating of the previous album, and commented how he considers this album as a part of the band's artistic peak alongside A Night At The Opera.\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited \"Tie Your Mother Down\" and \"Somebody to Love\", along with ballad \"You Take My Breath Away\", as the best tracks on the album, and said the album marked a point where Queen \"entered a new phase, where they're globe-conquering titans instead of underdogs on the make\". Q magazine wrote that \"the breadth of its ambition remains ever impressive, as do tracks such as May's stomping 'Tie Your Mother Down' and Mercury's baroque one-two, 'Somebody to Love' and 'Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy'.\" Ben Sisario, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), found the album \"a little too predictable\" and called it \"a quickie sequel to Opera.\" Similarly, AJ Ramirez, writing for PopMatters, described the album as \"a comparative comedown\" and \"a good but not stupendous record\", while acknowledging the band were \"now firmly in command of the mechanics of pop songcraft\", which had yielded them more singles than any previous album.\nIn 2006, a listener poll conducted by BBC Radio 2 saw A Day at the Races voted the 67th greatest album of all time. The same year, in a worldwide Guinness and NME poll to find the \"Greatest 100 Albums of All Time\", the album was voted number 87. It was also featured in Classic Rock and Metal Hammer's \"The 200 Greatest Albums of the 70s\", being listed as one of the 20 greatest albums of 1976. Out ranked it No. 20 of 100 in a poll of \"more than 100 actors, comedians, musicians, writers, critics, performance artists, label reps, and DJs, asking each to list the 10 albums that left the most indelible impressions on their lives.\" In the 1987 edition of The World Critics List, the BBC's Peter Powell ranked A Day at the Races the 6th greatest album of all time, and Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times included the record in his \"The Great Albums\" in 2006.",

The Game features a different sound from its predecessor, Jazz (1978). The Game was the first Queen album to use a synthesizer (an Oberheim OB-X).\nA critical and commercial success, The Game became the only Queen album to reach No. 1 in the US, and also became their best-selling studio album in the US, with four million copies sold to date, tying with the sales for News of the World. Notable songs on the album include the bass-driven \"Another One Bites the Dust\" and the rock and roll \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\", both of which reached No. 1 in the US. It was reissued in May 2003 on DVD-Audio with Dolby 5.1 surround sound and DTS 5.1. The 5.1 mix of \"Coming Soon\" features an alternate backing track, as the final master tapes could not be found when mixing the album to 5.1.",

But no such luck.\" Steve Taylor, writing for Smash Hits, was equally as dismissive, writing \"sandwiched between two slabs of Queen's usual symphonic and/or choral pomp-rock [...] lies a filling of utterly unoriginal corn\".\nCreem readers voted The Game the seventh greatest album of 1980. At the Grammy Awards in 1981, Queen and Mack were nominated for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) while \"Another One Bites the Dust\" was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Queen received an American Music Award nomination for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group, while \"Another One Bites the Dust\" received the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single.\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album's \"disco rock blends\" showed a band that has \"turned away from rock and toward pop\", \"turning decidedly, decisively pop, and it's a grand, state-of-the-art circa 1980 pop album that still stands as one of the band's most enjoyable records.\" AllMusic would go on to name The Game as Queen's best album of the 1980s. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called The Game a \"regular ol' rock album\". In 2008, Out ranked the album number 28 of 100 in a poll of \"more than 100 actors, comedians, musicians, writers, critics, performance artists, label reps, and DJs, asking each to list the ten albums that left the most indelible impressions on their lives.\"",

Everything was different. We turned our whole studio technique around in a sense, because Mack had come from a different background from us. We thought there was only one way of doing things, like doing backing tracks: We would just do it until we got it right. If there were some bits where it speeded up or slowed down, then we would do it again until it was right. We had done some of our old backing tracks so many times, they were too stiff. Mack's first contribution was to say, \"Well you don't have to do that. I can drop the whole thing in. If it breaks down after half a minute, then we can edit in and carry on if you just play along with the tempo\". We laughed and said \"Don't be silly. You can't do that\". But in fact, you can. What you gain is the freshness, because often a lot of the backing tracks is first time though. It really helped a lot. There was less guitar on that album, but that's really not going to be the same forever; that was just an experiment.",

Marking a notable shift in direction from their earlier work, they employed many elements of disco, funk, R&B, dance, pop and new wave music on the album. Combined with the ongoing backlash against disco music, this made the album less popular with fans who preferred the traditional rock style they had come to associate with the band. Queen's decision to record a dance-oriented album germinated with the massive success of their 1980 hit \"Another One Bites the Dust\" in the US.\n\"Under Pressure\", Queen's collaboration with David Bowie, was released in 1981 and became the band's second number one hit in the UK. Although included on Hot Space, the song was a separate project and was recorded ahead of the album, before the controversy over Queen's new disco-influenced rock sound. The album's second single, \"Body Language\", peaked at number 11 on the US charts.",

A departure from their trademark 1970s sound, most of Hot Space is a mixture of rhythm and blues, funk, dance and disco, while the rock songs continued in a pop rock direction similar to their previous album (an exception is the song \"Put Out the Fire\").\nDuring an interview in 1984, Roger Taylor affirmed that \"it was really John [Deacon]\" who turned the band towards a more disco sound. Elaborating, he said: \"John's always been R&B orientated, our bass player who wrote 'Another One Bites The Dust', ... which turned out to be the biggest selling record of the year. And I think that was the song that catapulted us into taking that road. I think we went too far and did too much. ... Everybody in the band feels that way now.\"\nDisliking the new sound, Brian May and Taylor were critical of the influence that Paul Prenter, Freddie Mercury's personal manager between 1977 and 1984, had on the singer. Recalling the recording process in 2011, Taylor openly criticized the direction in which Prenter was taking Mercury (and thus the rest of the band), stating that \"[Prenter] wanted our music to sound like you'd just walked in a gay club...and I didn't\". May also noted that the making of the album in Munich took much longer than usual and that all of the band got into \"deep emotional trouble\" in the city, blaming a mixture of drink, drugs and partying as the reason for the relatively lengthy recording sessions. According to Reinhold Mack, Queen's producer, Prenter loathed rock music and was in Mercury's ear throughout the Hot Space sessions. Prenter also refused all requests from US radio stations to speak to Mercury. May states, \"this guy, in the course of one tour, told every record station to fuck off. But not just \"fuck off\", but \"Freddie says, ‘fuck off’\". Queen roadie Peter Hince wrote \"None of the band cared for him [Prenter], apart from Freddie\", with Hince regarding Mercury's favouring of Prenter as an act of \"misguided loyalty\".",

It was also played on Queen's The Works Tour, until it was dropped from the setlist halfway through the European leg of the tour.

The song also appeared in the 1984 documentary film Stripper, being performed to by one of the dancers.

                "content": "Due to its dance-pop sound, Hot Space is widely considered by critics to be one of Queen's most artistically disappointing albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said of the album that \"the band that once proudly proclaimed not to use synthesizers on their albums has suddenly, dramatically reversed course, devoting the entire first side of the album to robotic, new wave dance-pop, all driven by drum machines and colored by keyboards, with Brian May's guitar coming in as flavor only on occasion.\" Alex Petridis of The Guardian gave the album two stars and said: \"Like Queen, disco was melodramatic, unrepentantly camp, extravagantly arranged and omnivorous in its influences. Or at least it had been. By the time of 1982's Hot Space, disco had mutated into the weird, skeletal, dubby electronic sound pioneered by DJ Larry Levan, which really didn't suit Queen at all.\" Despite this, \"Under Pressure\" remains one of the band's staple songs. However, neither of these reviews are contemporary, and would both be coloured by decades of the album's perceived reputation, so can hardly be considered to reflect its reception, in the way that the Sounds and Rolling Stone reviews can.\nSandy Robertson of Sounds gave the album four stars, describing it as \"fairly lickable funkpop\" featuring \"'Put Out The Fire'... with, plenty screaming Brian May axe histrionics ... a ballad in the old boy's mode called 'Life Is Real' ... a candymix of phasers, acoustics and electrics in 'Calling All Girls' ... sleazy keyboard/vocal pomp sobs in 'Las Palabras De Amor' ... a languid summer streak and slow slide through 'Cool Cat' and the cornerstone 'Under Pressure' itself.\"\nRolling Stone's review at the time said Queen offered \"a bit more than bluster\", but described all but four of the songs as \"at best, routinely competent and, at times, downright offensive\".",

It taught me that even if you're in a band as a guitar player, music doesn't have to be driven by guitar – it's about the song, first. But I think the main thing is that Queen actually did an album like that – it was the fans' least favorite, but it was one of my favorites because it took a risk and branched out. All those synth parts they did and horns, I could always hear them with guitar in my head somehow. But quite oddly enough, or coincidentally enough, the title Hot Space is exactly what it meant: it's all the space between the music. That's what makes it funky and that's what makes it have a pocket.\"\nIn the 2011 documentary Queen: Days of our Lives, Queen's former manager Jim Beach described Hot Space as \"a disaster really [...] it didn't appeal to the hardcore Queen fans who would turn up to concerts with 'Disco Sucks' banners.\"\nAfter the conclusion of the Hot Space tour in late 1982, the band would rarely include songs from the album in their later live set-lists with only \"Under Pressure\" remaining as a staple until their final concerts in 1986.",

It was the first Queen album to go Gold in the US upon its release since The Works in 1984.\nThe album was recorded between March 1989 and November 1990. In the spring of 1987, Mercury had been diagnosed with AIDS, although he kept his illness a secret from the public and denied numerous media reports that he was seriously ill. The band and producers were aiming for a November or December release date in order to catch the crucial Christmas market, but Mercury's declining health meant that the release of the album did not take place until February 1991. Stylistically, Innuendo has been regarded as a return to Queen's mid-1970s bombastic period of exaggerated music and lavish production. Nine months after the album was released, on 24 November, Mercury died of AIDS-derived bronchopneumonia, a day after he publicly revealed his condition.\nThe album cover was designed by Queen and Richard Gray. The booklets and single covers from the album are inspired by illustrations by 19th century French artist Jean-Jacques Grandville. Innuendo was voted the 94th greatest album of all time in a national 2006 BBC poll.",

                "content": "Queen released their thirteenth album, The Miracle, in May 1989, but unlike their previous albums, they did not conduct a live tour. In an interview Freddie Mercury conducted with BBC Radio 1, he said that he wanted to break from the \"album – tour – album – tour\" routine. He had privately been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1987, and at the time of the interview had been diagnosed with AIDS, which was not yet publicised; however, rumours had been spreading since 1988 about his health and of the possibility that he had the disease, with speculation fuelled by a clear physical decline in his appearance, particularly weight loss. While he kept quiet due to his preference not to talk to the media, the other band members denied the rumours; at one point, band member Roger Taylor told reporters that \"he is healthy and working\". In February 1990, Queen won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. While Mercury accepted the award for the band at the Dominion Theatre, Brian May spoke for the band. Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance at the ceremony sparked further speculation from the public about his health, which persisted throughout 1990. The 1990 BRIT Awards would be Mercury's final public appearance.\nMercury did not speak publicly about his health, saying that he did not want to sell his music out of people's sympathy for him. He was determined to continue working on music with Queen for as long as he could, saying that he would \"keep working until I fucking drop\". Mercury was persistently bothered by reporters at his London home, making it difficult for the band to record. As a result, the band relocated to Mountain Studios in Montreux, where the safer and more peaceful atmosphere allowed the band to concentrate. Early in Innuendo's recording, the band decided that all work would be again credited to Queen as a whole instead of to individual contributing members; May said that the decision made a significant impact in the recording process, while Taylor said that it helped eliminate much of the egotistical struggles that would normally cause bands to break up.\nThe album was released in the US under a new label, the Disney-owned Hollywood Records, in an effort to garner greater exposure there. Hollywood had also secured the rights to Queen's Elektra and Capitol back catalogues, and began reissuing albums early in 1991, marking Queen's 20th anniversary.",

Freddie Mercury was upstairs and heard them playing the beat, and turned it into a song, creating the melody and starting off the lyrics. From then on all four worked on polishing the track and Taylor took over the lyrics (which were written as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and their song \"Kashmir\"). The middle section, written by Mercury, was included later and it features a synth-orchestra programmed by producer David Richards and a flamenco interlude played by Yes guitarist Steve Howe, who had come to visit them and was asked to play. \"Innuendo\" was released as a single in January 1991, debuting at No. 1 in the UK.",

Most of the lyrics like \"banana tree\" or \"one needle\", came from both him and his friend Peter Straker, who stayed up all night in Mercury's kitchen, devising ever more outlandish lines. The music is Mercury's and is one of the earliest songs the band were working on in Montreux when Steve Howe came in.\nThe video that accompanied the song saw Mercury dressed in a costume suit with wild hair, white gloves, long pointing shoes and extremely heavy make up, filmed in black and white. Whilst Queen fans were thoroughly amused by the band in the video, in the documentary, Champions of the World, Taylor confessed, from the band's perspective, the video was marred by Mercury's appearance having to be camouflaged by costume and make-up, as Taylor admitted Mercury looked \"pretty ill, at that point.\"",

It was said to be more along the lines of how May and Taylor originally wanted the track to sound, with a harder, guitar-driven rock edge. May has stated in an interview that most of the original demo is in the recording, making the song \"impossible\" to mix.",

                        "content": "\"Bijou\" was an idea Mercury and May had of making a song \"inside-out\", having guitar doing the verses and the vocal doing the break. Mercury put the chords, title and lyrics, and the two of them worked on the guitar parts. Mercury sang the first line and then May transferred the melody to his Red Special. The song was finished without any input from Taylor or Deacon. The inspiration for the song itself is twofold, Brian May; “The vocal is a succinct and very precise little verse, a little gem, a \"Bijou\" - a jewel buried at the heart of the piece: hence the name of the song.”  “My Mum was given a budgie by a friend - it became a great companion for her after she lost my Dad. She called it \"Bijou\" and she would spend hours talking to it! ..It was her little Bijou.”  In 2008, Queen + Paul Rodgers performed this song in their shows of the Rock the Cosmos Tour by May playing the verse live and then having Mercury's studio vocals play while a screen showed footage from the band's Wembley concert in 1986, with the visuals put in sync with the tape.",

May decided to use the sequence, and both he and Mercury decided the theme of the lyrics and wrote the first verse together. From then on May finished the lyrics, completed the vocal melody and wrote the bridge, inspired by Pachelbel's Canon. Some keys and ideas were also suggested by the producer. The song chronicles the effort of Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life. The song was initially not released as a single as part of promotion for the Innuendo album, but was released in October 1991 as the band launched their Greatest Hits II album. The video for the song features a compilation of clips from all their videos since 1982, in support of the Greatest Hits II album. Due to Mercury's critical health at the time of its production, a fresh appearance by the band in a video was not possible. The track is a personal favourite of fellow British artist Elton John, who performed the song at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with the remaining members of Queen, and Tony Iommi playing rhythm guitar. A different live version featuring Elton John on vocals later appeared on Queen's Greatest Hits III album.",

The song also achieved modest success in the US, charting at No. 17 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Still, the length and style of the track limited its appeal, and it only spent one week at No. 1 in the UK and quickly slid down the chart, spending only six weeks in the top 75.

It entered the UK charts at No. 14, and reached No. 3 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

The 12\" and CD also feature \"Mad the Swine\").\n\"I Can't Live with You\" was released as a promo single to radio stations in the US. This two-track promo single, completely remixed by Brian Malouf, uses slightly different lead vocal tracks by Mercury, louder and tighter harmony tracks, and reprogrammed synth drums, resulting in a much more punchy and \"over the top\" poppy version than included on the album. It reached No. 28 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" was first released in the US on Mercury's birthday, 5 September 1991 on cassette and to radio. In the UK it was released in December 1991 following Mercury's death, as a double A-side with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The single was the UK's Christmas No. 1 of 1991.\n\"The Show Must Go On\" was released on 14 October 1991 in the UK. The single was taken from the album but was released as promotion for the Greatest Hits II album (Classic Queen in the US/Canada), and peaked at No. 16 on the UK charts. After Mercury's death in November, the song re-entered the British charts and spent as many weeks in the top 75 as it had upon its original release. This single was released just six weeks before Mercury died. In 1992, the song was released as a double A-side with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" in the US where it reached No. 2; the B-side for the original October 1991 release was \"Keep Yourself Alive\".",

In 2016, for the same publication, Ron Hart described it as \"Queen's last masterpiece\" and an album which \"boldly confronted mortality,\" likening it to David Bowie's final album Blackstar.\nPeople wrote, \"If this is cartoon rock and roll, at least it's good and brazenly cartoonish.\" The Orange County Register wrote, \"Queen dispenses with any stylistic variations or flirtations with dance music and offers its basic sound: lots of Mercury vocal leaps, fuzzed-out May guitar, choral overdubs and a sense of orchestral importance mixed with straightforward hard rock\", concluding that it was a \"mixed bag\". The LA Times wrote, \"Given the bombast and harsh assault of Queen's biggest hits, it's a shock to find that the heart of... Innuendo, is made of soft, sweet, sticky, sentimental goo\", but added \"the goo actually goes down well\" and \"Queen hasn't forgotten how to rock.\"\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic wrote, \"Innuendo was a fitting way to end one of rock's most successful careers\". For Classic Rock in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked it as Queen's ninth greatest album, writing that \"Innuendo had a lot of intelligent humour and pathos about it.\" He praised the title track's \"brilliantly synthesised orchestrations\" and added \"perhaps most poignant of all is the low key yet mesmerising 'These Are The Days Of Our Lives', which ended with Mercury’s whispered paean 'I still love you', which was moving in its simplicity.\" Dome concluded, \"The album summed up how Queen could draw people close, yet still keep them at a convenient distance.\"",

        "summary": "Jazz is the seventh studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 10 November 1978 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker, the album artwork was suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a similar design painted on the Berlin Wall. The album's varying musical styles were alternately praised and criticised. It reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and number six on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart.",

                "content": "Rehearsals for Jazz began during the first week of July 1978. The month before, in June, the band had received a hefty tax bill and subsequently decided to record outside of the United Kingdom. They had to make a swift decision, as Brian May would be forced out of the UK on 2 July due to these tax-related issues. This was shortly after the birth of his first child, Jimmy.  As May relocated to Canada, the rest of the band flew to Nice, France, to begin rehearsing for the album. May soon joined the rehearsals.\nThe band attended the nearby Montreux Jazz Festival, which likely inspired the title of the album. There, they ran into David Bowie, who was working on his 1979 album Lodger between tour dates. Bowie convinced them to record at Mountain Studios in Montreux.\nBefore the band shifted to Montreux, they finished preliminary recordings of \"Don't Stop Me Now\", \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"In Only Seven Days\", and \"More of That Jazz\". Production on the album was moved to Montreux the day after the jazz festival. On 19 July, May's 31st birthday, the band attended the 18th stage of the 1978 Tour de France, which inspired Freddie Mercury to write the lead single, \"Bicycle Race\".\nDuring the next three weeks the band were in Mountain Studios, they primarily worked on \"Fun It\", \"Jealousy,\" \"Leaving Home Ain't Easy,\" \"Let Me Entertain You.\" The band took a few days off, most notably on 26 July when they trashed a Montreux hotel whilst celebrating Taylor's 29th birthday. Mercury was reportedly seen swinging on a cut-glass chandelier in the hotel during the party.\nAfter a brief holiday in the middle of August, the band moved production back to France, where they worked at Super Bear Studios. They would spend the rest of the month recording \"Mustapha\", \"Bicycle Race\", \"If You Can't Beat Them\", \"Dead On Time\", and \"Dreamer's Ball\" (based on the previous lists of completed songs).\nThe band completed overdubbing the songs in September, and mixed the lead single early before sending it to New York City for mastering, which was completed on 14 September. They mixed the rest of the album beginning in the middle of the month. Jazz was officially completed on 14 October, during a mastering session at Super Bear Studios.",

Some understandable words are \"Mustapha\", \"Ibrahim\" and the phrases \"Allah, Allah, Allah we'll pray for you\", \"salaam alaykum\" and \"alaykum salaam\".\nIn live performances, such as the performance on Live Killers, Mercury would often sing the opening vocals of \"Mustapha\" in place of the complex introduction to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", going from \"Allah, will pray for you\" to \"Mama, just killed a man...\". He also sang the intro before launching the band into \"Hammer to Fall\", as seen on We Are the Champions: Final Live in Japan. However, from the 1979 Saarbrücken Festival to the South American Game Tour, the band performed an almost full version of the song, with Mercury at the piano.",

If you need a fix, if you want a high, Stickells will see to that.\" And then, on the very next line, Mercury mentions Queen's record labels at the time (Elektra, and EMI) with the line \"With Elektra and EMI; we'll show you where it's at!\".

Marsh said \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" treated women \"not as sex objects but as objects, period (the way the band regards people in general)\", and finished by famously tagging Queen \"the first truly fascist rock band\". Mitchell Cohen of Creem gave another negative review, calling Jazz \"absurdly dull\" and filled with \"dumb ideas and imitative posturing\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said the album was not wholly bad, even finding \"Bicycle Race\" humorous, although he said Queen sounded like the band 10cc \"with a spoke, or a pump, up their ass\". The Los Angeles Times concluded that, \"while the surfaces remain as mainstream and as accessible as ever, there's a maturity to Queen that suggests even more advances are possible.\"\nIn a retrospective assessment, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as \"one of their sleekest albums.\" He cited that the album's diversity and exaggeration made it \"more fun than any of their other albums.\" Alexis Petridis wrote in The Guardian, \"Jazz was hysterical in every sense of the word, but the music press comprehensively failed to get the joke, particularly in the US\". In 2006, Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times included it in his list of \"The Great Albums,\" describing it as \"a genre-hopping tour of diverse musical styles\" and concluded that \"What ultimately keeps me coming back to the album, however, is that ambiguous sexual energy running through all 13 tracks; the fact that each of them boasts more hooks than some bands have on an entire album, and the inviting sonic density of it all.\" Chicago Tribune was less favorable, awarding the album 1 and a half stars.\nWhen Loudersound ranked every Queen album from best to worst, Jazz came fourth, as they felt it presented \"some of the most satisfying moments in Queen's career.\" In a similar list of the band's greatest albums, Ultimate Classic Rock placed Jazz in third position. \"Whenever discussions take place about Queen's incredible string of classic albums throughout the late '70s,\" they wrote, \"1978's 'Jazz' is the one that often seems to get the shortest shrift, but tucked away behind its unusually nondescript cover art lies one of the band's finest albums. Never mind the reliable hit single double-whammy provided by 'Fat Bottomed Girls' and 'Bicycle Race,' Jazz is astonishingly deep with underrated Queen gems, ranging from Mercury's Eastern-spiced wig-out 'Mustapha,' to Deacon's head-banging beast 'If You Can't Beat Them, Join Them,' to Taylor's infectious disco tune 'Fun It'.\"\nRolling Stone subsequently featured it on their list of 10 Classic Albums Rolling Stone Initially Panned, indicating they now regarded the album as a \"classic.\" They poked fun at Marsh's original negative review of the album, quipping, \"Sometimes a reviewer just seems to have a really, really low opinion of a band, which seems to be the case with Dave Marsh and Queen.\"",

        "summary": "A Kind of Magic is the twelfth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 2 June 1986 by EMI Records in the UK and by Capitol Records in the US. It is based on the soundtrack to the film Highlander, directed by Russell Mulcahy.\nA Kind of Magic was Queen's first album to be released since they had received acclaim for their performance at Live Aid in 1985. It was an immediate hit in the UK, going straight to number one and selling 100,000 copies in its first week. It remained in the UK charts for 63 weeks, selling 600,000 in the UK alone. The album spawned four hit singles: the album's title track \"A Kind of Magic\", \"One Vision\", \"Friends Will Be Friends\", and \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", which features an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen, while the album's final track, \"Princes of the Universe\", is the theme song to Highlander.\nAlthough Queen would release another two albums in Freddie Mercury's lifetime, A Kind of Magic would turn out to be Queen's last album promoted with a concert tour, due to Mercury's diagnosis with AIDS the following year.",

The title, \"A Kind of Magic\", derived from one of the lines character Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) says to describe his immortality. Six out of nine songs on the album appeared in the film, although in different versions. The three songs that did not appear in Highlander are \"Pain Is So Close to Pleasure\", \"Friends Will Be Friends\" and \"One Vision\", which was featured a year earlier in the film Iron Eagle. Conversely, a recording of \"Theme from New York, New York\" made specifically for a scene in Highlander does not appear on A Kind of Magic, and in fact has never been released in album form to date. Band member Brian May, according to a statement he made on the Greatest Video Hits 2 DVD (2003), had, at least at that point, the intention to work on a proper Highlander soundtrack in the future. In one scene, a snippet of \"Hammer to Fall\" plays on a radio, a song from the previously released The Works album.",

The group can be dazzling. In this case they're just overbearing\". Kerrang!'s Paul Henderson wondered \"how much of the album is the 'real' Queen and how much is the result of the constraints/musical slant imposed upon them by writing material to go with a movie\", concluding that \"only a band of Queen's stature (...) could put out an album of such diverse songs without disappointing a sizeable portion of their fans\".\nIn a retrospective review, Greg Prato of AllMusic wrote: \"It may not have been as cohesive as some of their other albums, but A Kind of Magic was their best work in some time\". Queen biographer Mark Blake wrote: \"The album's confused origins made for a somewhat uneven listening experience... only the title cut and 'Who Wants to Live Forever' were songs that would survive the album's natural shelf life. Like every Queen record since Jazz, A Kind of Magic was a so-so album, cleverly loaded with two or three potential hit singles\".\nIn the 1994 edition of The Guinness All Time Top 1000 Albums, the album was voted No. 171 in the all-time greatest rock and pop albums. In 2006, a national BBC poll saw the album voted the 42nd-greatest album of all time. In 2007, Classic Rock ranked A Kind of Magic the 28th-greatest soundtrack album of all time.",

Following Mercury's death, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bass guitarist John Deacon worked with vocal and piano parts that Mercury recorded before his death, adding new instrumentation to the recordings. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album debuted at number 1 in the UK, where it went quadruple platinum selling 1.2 million copies. 500,000 copies were shipped in the United States.\nDuring and after the recordings, Queen released the single \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" in 1997 and only played sporadic concerts together until 2004, when May and Taylor started touring with Bad Company frontman Paul Rodgers and later with Adam Lambert; Deacon retired from music in 1997 and has not taken part in any Queen activity since then.\nThe cover for the album has two different photos: the CD cover photo was shot at dusk, depicting Irena Sedlecká's Mercury sculpture located at Lake Geneva in Montreux, Switzerland, on the front, with May, Taylor and Deacon gazing at the Alps on the rear cover; meanwhile, the LP cover photo was shot in the same spot at dawn, depicting the same statue on the front but with May, Taylor and Deacon gazing at the sunrise on the rear cover.",

                "content": "The album was recorded in a much different way from Queen's other studio albums. In early 1991, having completed work on Innuendo, and some months before his death, Freddie Mercury recorded as many vocals as he could, with the instruction to the rest of the band (Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon) to complete the songs later. Put to tape during this time were primarily \"A Winter's Tale\", \"Mother Love\" and what would eventually become \"You Don't Fool Me\".\nIn the documentary  Champions of the World, May described these sessions with Mercury as such:\n\nBy the time we were recording these other tracks after Innuendo, we had had the discussions and we knew that we were totally on borrowed time because Freddie had been told that he would not make it to that point. I think our plan was to go in there whenever Freddie felt well enough, just to make as much use of him as possible, we basically lived in the studio for a while and when he would call and say, 'I can come in for a few hours', our plan was to just make as much use of him as we could, you know he told us, 'Get me to sing anything, write me anything and I will sing it and I will leave you as much as I possibly can.'\nProducer David Richards also added:\n\nThe thing that was really unusual about these last songs they recorded was that Freddie insisted on doing final vocals. Normally he had always wanted to wait until all the music was completed before he would put his final vocal on. There must have been a reason for this, I think he felt there wasn't enough time to have it completed in time. Which also means that he definitely wanted these things to be released, there's simply no other reason why he would have done that.\nAfter Mercury's death, the band returned to the studio in 1993 to begin work on finishing the tracks. May has described in interviews that Taylor and Deacon had begun some work in 1992, while May was on tour promoting his Back to the Light album. Upon his return in 1993, May felt they were not on the right path with the music and they more or less started from scratch with the three of them working together with producer David Richards.\nWith less than an album's worth to work with, the band decided to revisit previously recorded material. The band did not discuss whether Mercury had any input before his death regarding which songs might be considered. The idea was to take existing songs on which Mercury sang and rework them as Queen songs.\nIn 2013, Brian May said about the album \"[Made in Heaven] was possibly the best Queen album we ever made. It has so much beauty in it. It was a long, long process, painstakingly put together. A real labour of love.\"",

Mercury's vocals for \"Mother Love\" were recorded 13–16 May 1991. On his website, May discussed the writing process he and Mercury had (writing both separately and together, and conscious of the nature of the song and the lyrics). Upon reaching the final verse, Mercury told May that he had to go and \"have a rest\", but that he would return later and finish it. Mercury never made it back to the studio due to his worsening condition, thus May sang the last verse on the track.\nThe song features a sample of the vocal improvisation from Queen's famous 12 July 1986 concert at Wembley Stadium, and a sample from the intro of the studio version of \"One Vision\" and \"Tie Your Mother Down\". It also features a sample from a cover of \"Goin' Back\", a song written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, for which Mercury had provided lead vocals in 1972. The cover was released as a B-side to \"I Can Hear Music\", a Ronettes cover, by Larry Lurex (a pseudonym of Mercury's), not long before the release of Queen's debut album. The sound bursts between the sing along and the \"Goin' Back\" sample are apparently a few milliseconds of every Queen track ever recorded, put together, and then rapidly sped through a tape machine. At the very end of the song, a baby is heard crying. This video is age-restricted on YouTube.\n\nOfficial video (using a short film) on YouTube",

That track became popular in Japan during 2004 when it was used for the theme song of a television drama named Pride (プライド). This version also contains samples of Mercury's ad-lib vocals from \"A Kind of Magic\", from the 1986 album of the same name, and from \"Living on My Own\", from his Mr. Bad Guy album.

Whether she turned it down or Taylor withdrew the song is unclear, but it was recorded by his other band The Cross. One night Mercury came to visit The Cross at the studio and after some drinks he gave them ideas of how to sing the song and ended up recording the lead vocals for it. Mercury appeared on the UK version of their album Shove It as guest lead vocalist on the song, with Taylor doing backing vocals. The roles were reversed on the single and the American version of Shove It. Mercury's vocals were then used for the Made in Heaven release, with a couple of different lines and May singing backing vocals instead of Taylor, with Richards adding several arrangement ideas. It was released as the leading single two weeks before the album's release, with the song's music video commemorating Mercury, and also containing footage of various silent films from the 1900s, including Walter R. Booth's 1906 film The '?' Motorist, Georges Méliès' seminal 1902 film A Trip to the Moon as well as his 1904 film The Impossible Voyage.",

However, there were some problems with the companies representing publishing rights for Musker and Lamers so they could not release the song properly on The Miracle. The song even appears in the original track listing between \"I Want It All\" and \"The Invisible Man\", but was deleted. This is the only track on the Made in Heaven album which wasn't reworked by the remaining members of the band during 1993–1995 sessions, as it is the original 1989 mix prepared for The Miracle.\nAt The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, May played the song on piano and sang it for the first time in public and then released it as part of his solo album Back to the Light. Its arrangement differs to the Queen version, featuring acoustic guitar solo and no drums. However May played this track live with his touring band in 1992–1993 using an arrangement similar to the original Queen version. The song was awarded Best Song Musically and Lyrically at the 1997 Novello Awards.\nThis song was also performed by Queen and Luciano Pavarotti in 2003, with Pavarotti singing the latter parts of the verses in Italian.",

An essential purchase for Queen fans, certainly, but even without its special significance, Made in Heaven is probably a better album than Innuendo and a fitting swan song by one of the most incandescent groups in rock. Made in Heaven is also the last musical will and testament of a star who was never going to be turned into a saint, but whose grandstanding performances were, right to the very end, always marked by reckless enthusiasm and a rare generosity of spirit.\"\nThe Sunday Times described the album as \"essential listening\".\nEntertainment Weekly wrote: \"It's the perfect theatrical epitaph for a life dedicated to gorgeous artifice.\"\nThe Guardian stated: \"When a band have the controls permanently set at full-tilt, as Queen did, burn-out is inevitable, for the listener, if not for the band. When we eventually reach the drum-crashing finale, 'It's a Beautiful Day', which kicks in with Mercury's umpteenth randy-rottweiler howl, it feels as if far more than 70 minutes has passed. That's where the aforesaid lyrics save the day. Predominantly written by Mercury, they are effectively farewell notes. He poured out his heart, and his words have a throat-aching poignance. Even the record's opening verse assumes a painful significance.\"\nJerusalem Post wrote: \"Somehow Mercury and Queen's ability to make a joyful noise in the face of pain and death makes this a very comforting album to have around in shaky times.\"\nThe Times stated: \"[There are not] any obviously half-baked, or patched-up numbers. Most, however, are as good as anything that Queen came up with in their later years. How good that is, as always with Queen, is largely a matter of taste. 'Mother Love', the last recording that Mercury made, is a song of truly heartfelt pathos. Despite its overdue delivery, Made in Heaven stands up remarkably well as the closing chapter in a spectacular pop odyssey.\"\nAllMusic wrote: \"Made in Heaven harked back to Queen's 1970s heyday with its strong melodies and hard rock guitar playing, topped by Mercury's bravura singing and some of the massed choir effects familiar from 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Even if one did not know that these songs were sung in the shadow of death, that subject would be obvious. The lyrics were imbued with life-and-death issues, from the titles. The odd thing about this was that Mercury's over-the-top singing had always contained a hint of camp humour, and it continued to here, even when the sentiments clearly were as heartfelt as they were theatrically overstated. Maybe Mercury was determined to go out the same way he had come in, as a diva. If so, he succeeded.\"",

        "summary": "The Miracle is the thirteenth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 22 May 1989 by Parlophone Records and Capitol Records in both the United Kingdom and the U.S. respectively, where it was the band's third and final studio album to be released on latter label, and their first studio album on the former label. The album was recorded following Brian May's marital problems and Freddie Mercury's HIV diagnosis in 1987. Recording started in January 1988 and lasted for an entire year. The album was originally going to be called The Invisible Men, but three weeks before the release, according to Roger Taylor, they changed the name to The Miracle. It was also the last Queen album with a photo of all four members on the front cover.\nThe album reached number one in the UK, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and number 24 on the US Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. AllMusic would name The Miracle as Queen's best album of the 1980s, along with The Game. It would prove to be the band's penultimate album to be released in Freddie Mercury's lifetime, as he died on 24 November 1991, nine months after their next album, Innuendo, was released.",

Mercury sang lead vocals for most of the song, but Mercury and May share lead vocals during the bridge. Mercury played keyboards, May played acoustic and electric guitars while Taylor used double-kick bass drums for the first (and only) time.",

Each of the four band members are name-checked in the vocals by Freddie throughout the course of the song: \"Freddie Mercury\" right before the first verse begins (done by Roger Taylor), \"John Deacon\" after the first verse, \"Brian May\" (said twice) before his guitar solo, and \"Roger Taylor\" (with the initial \"r\" rolled by Mercury to sound like a drum roll) after the final chorus; Taylor \"answers\" with a drum fill. The demo version contains a completely different middle-eight with Mercury singing alternate lyrics in the style of Elvis Presley. The whispered parts of the chorus are sung by Taylor.",

The song became an anti-apartheid anthem among youth in South Africa and also has been used to protest other causes. This well-known anthem has been heard as a rallying song for African youth. The song became Queen's first American rock radio hit since \"Under Pressure\" by peaking at number three on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Singles chart, but only reached number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.\n\"Breakthru\" was the second single from the album released in the UK on 19 June; its video was filmed on a private steam train known as The Miracle Express. The song peaked at number seven in the UK. The song was also released as a single in the US. Also appearing in the video was Debbie Leng, who was at the time Roger Taylor's girlfriend.\n\"The Invisible Man\", released in the UK on 7 August, hit number 12 in the UK and was a hit throughout Europe; the video showed scores of computer-duplicated band members moving in unison. This song was later covered by Scatman John.\n\"Scandal\" was the album's fourth single, and peaked at number 25 in the UK. It is a protest song about the way the tabloids dealt with May's relationship with Anita Dobson.\n\"The Miracle\" was the fifth and final single from the album, released on 27 November in the UK, reaching number 21 on the British charts. Its video involved young Queen lookalikes (including a then-unknown Ross McCall) who performed a Queen-style stage show. The real band appeared only at the end jamming with their younger counterparts.",

From one track to the next there is, as usual, no telling which way this band will go, affording even the most jaded ear a challenge.\"\nNewsday (Melville, NY) wrote \"On The Miracle, Mercury's voice is steady and solid, May's runs are as flashy and supple as ever. Most of the 10 songs, written collaboratively by the four members, stick pretty much to the band's formula of mini-suites: edgy pop with tempos that change half-way into the number and some delicious hooks.\"\nRolling Stone stated \"The Miracle is a showcase for Freddie Mercury and his love of sweeping, quasi-operatic vocals. And indeed, Mercury – especially on the title track – has never sounded better... Only on a few tracks (\"Khashoggi's Ship\" and \"Was It All Worth It\") does May really let it rip, and when he does, it's like the old Queen peeping out for just a moment and then turning tail... At least The Miracle offers little snippets of Queen's former majesty.\"\nAllMusic stated \"The Miracle packs quite a sonic punch, recalling the rich sounds of their past classics (1976's A Day at the Races, etc.). Split 50/50 between pop and heavy rock, the album was another global smash. Along with The Game, The Miracle is Queen's strongest album of the '80s.\"",

        "summary": "News of the World is the sixth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 28 October 1977 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. News of the World was the band's second album to be recorded at Sarm and Wessex Sound Studios in London, and engineered by Mike Stone, and was co-produced by the band and Stone.\nIn 1977, punk rock acts, most notably the Sex Pistols, sparked massive backlash against progressive rock artists such as Queen, to which the band responded by simplifying their symphonic rock sound and gearing towards a more spontaneous hard rock sound. The album subsequently reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 3 on the US Top Albums chart while achieving high certifications around the world. It has sold over 4 million copies in United States. Its lead single, \"We Are the Champions\", reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number four on the Billboard Hot 100. Critical reaction to News of the World was initially mixed, with many reviewers commenting on the band's change in musical style. However, it has since come to be regarded as one of Queen's greatest albums, while \"We Are the Champions\" and \"We Will Rock You\" have since become rock anthems.",

                "content": "After completing the \"A Day at the Races Tour\" in June 1977, the quartet entered the studio to begin work on their sixth studio offering in July 1977, enlisting Mike Stone as assistant producer at Sarm East and Wessex studios in London. The initial activity began on 4 July when Taylor and assistant 'Crystal' Taylor arrived in a lorry at Sarm to set up his drum kit, which continued over the next two days. That Wednesday, on 6 July, the rest of the band arrived at Sarm. They did backing track takes for \"It's Late\".\nAfter recording all the backing tracks, work moved to Wessex Sound, again preceded by two days dedicated to drum kit set up. The lorry arrived on 1 August, and drum kit construction would continue well into 2 August. Andy Turner, a tea boy at Wessex, recalls thinking \"You're being charged £200 an hour for this!\"  At Wessex, the band overdubbed onto the backing tracks. Some songs had been previously overdubbed, such as \"It's Late\", \"Who Needs You\", \"All Dead All Dead\", and \"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\". During the last few days of overdubbing, on 22 August, calls to the U.S. would be made regarding venues for the band's tour in November.\nAccording to studio documentation, a lot of sessions had late arrivals, which were usually pre-arranged around an hour before the band would actually arrive. The median shift length was around 3–11pm, but sometimes the band would stay in the studio until 4am if they were falling behind schedule. The last principal overdubbing session was on 23 August, with the first mixes the next day on 24 August. Occasionally, further overdubbing would occur, as mixing continued. On 26 August, \"We Are The Champions\" was mixed, followed by \"Spread Your Wings\", and \"We Will Rock You\" on 27 August, and Take 12 of \"Sheer Heart Attack\" on 28 August.\nAfter taking a day off for the Summer Bank Holiday, the band went to Leighton Mans Studios and Primrose Hill Studios on 30 August, although the output of these sessions is unknown. They also spent a day at Olympic Studios on 31 August. The last documented overdubbing session was on 1 September. Mixing continued until 4 September at Wessex, during which there was a delay on 3 September due to technical issues. That day, Roger appeared on the last episode of the show \"Saturday Scene\". The mixes were delivered back to Sarm Studios on 5 September for mastering, which would be completed on 16 September.\n\nThey scaled down their complex arrangements and focused on a \"rootsier\" sound (as Brian May put it). However, the staple of the Queen sound – multi-tracked harmonies and guitar orchestrations – still exist on this album, albeit more subtly than previously. Having received some criticism that their first completely self-produced album, A Day at the Races, was a \"boring\" album, Queen decided to shift their musical focus towards the mainstream but remain as the producers of the next album. Races garnered criticism as many critics felt that it was too similar to A Night at the Opera, something which the band members themselves acknowledged. In addition, the arrival of punk rock, led by the Sex Pistols, saw the mainstream shift away from progressive rock and more towards simpler rock music. Queen were seen as the antithesis of punk, particularly in their camp influences and elaborate production.\nBrian May stated in an interview that \"We'd already made a decision that...[after] A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races, we wanted to go back to basics for News of the World. But it was very timely because the world was looking at punk and things being very stripped down. So in a sense we were conscious, but it was part of our evolution anyway.\"\nIn contrast to A Day at the Races, which had taken five months to record, only two months were booked to record at Sarm East and Wessex Sound Studios. Most of the recording sessions took place in Wessex Studios, which was also where the Sex Pistols were busy recording Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. As such, the two groups had several interactions, including the famous meeting between Mercury and Sid Vicious. Vicious, upon stumbling into Queen's recording studio, asked \"Have you succeeded in bringing ballet to the masses yet?\" in response to a comment the singer had made in an interview with NME, to which Mercury called him \"Simon Ferocious\" (a playful reference to Vicious' stage name) and replied \"We're doing our best, dear.\" Johnny Rotten also expressed a desire to meet with Mercury. According to Bill Price, who engineered Never Mind the Bollocks, Rotten crawled on all fours across Queen's studio to Mercury, who was playing piano, and said \"Hello Freddie\" before leaving. Queen's history with the Sex Pistols dated back to December 1976, in which Queen were set to appear on Bill Grundy's Today show. However, Mercury had a toothache, and was forced to schedule a dentist appointment on the same day, his first one in 15 years. As a replacement, EMI offered the Sex Pistols instead, which led to their now famous appearance on the Today show.",

It has been classified as hard rock and arena rock, and has been regarded as a transitional album due to its shift towards a more minimalist production. Its songs are notable for their eclectic themes which would crystallise on future albums Jazz and The Game: \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\" are arena rock, \"Who Needs You\" features a Latin influence, \"Sheer Heart Attack\" is punk rock, \"Sleeping on the Sidewalk\" is based upon blues rock, \"Get Down, Make Love\" features funk overtones, \"My Melancholy Blues\" imitates jazz and \"Fight from the Inside\" was the group's first disco related song. Chuck Eddy said the album was widely regarded as a \"back-to-basics\" offering, minimising the group's more ornate and \"multi-part-epic tendencies\", with some even dubbing it Queen's response to punk rock. He added, however, that the record \"sounds even more often like a response to funk\", citing \"Fight from the Inside\" and \"Get Down, Make Love\", as well as the \"proto-rap sparseness\" of \"We Will Rock You\".",

It was a conscious decision by Brian May to make the song simple and anthemic ('stomp, stomp, clap, pause' per 4/4 measure), so that their live audience could be more directly involved in the show. In the videos for 'We Will Rock You' and 'Spread Your Wings', which shows the band performing in the snow in Roger Taylor's garden, May used a copy of his guitar. He supposedly did not want to submit his Red Special to the weather.\nOn 7 October 2017, Queen released a Raw Sessions version of the track to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of News of the World. It shows a radically different approach to the guitar solo and includes May's count-in immediately prior to the recording.",

Eddy calls it one of the album's funkier tracks, with a \"proto-industrial-music perviness\" which eventually morph into \"sex-moaning psychedelic spaces\" that constitute a form of 'dub-metal' comparable to similar parts of Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\".\nThe song was introduced into the band's live show immediately after its release, and remained a staple of their \"medley\" until the end of the Hot Space Tour of 1982. On the Hot Space tour, the song was reduced to the first verse/chorus only as a way to lead into May's guitar solo. In live versions of this song, Taylor used Latin-influenced percussion with timbales on the News of the World Tour, and tightly tuned Remo Roto-Toms on the Jazz Tour, Crazy Tour, The Game and Hot Space tours.\nThe distinctive 'psychedelic' sound effects heard in the song were not produced on a synthesiser, but on May's Red Special and an Electroharmonix Frequency Analyzer pedal, which he would often do live. The studio cut made use of an Eventide Harmonizer. These sound effects, together with Mercury's moans and groans, were expanded upon during live renditions of the song, the band taking an opportunity to show off the full potential of their stage lights and effects.\nA more aggressive version of this song was covered by the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails as a B-side for the 1990 single, \"Sin\". It was later added as a bonus track to the 2010 remastered edition of Pretty Hate Machine.",

May sings with an American accent and measures the aforementioned trumpet player's success by \"bucks\" (dollars), as opposed to pounds or \"quid\". On a close inspection, Deacon can be heard playing the wrong notes in some bass parts, and May can also be heard laughing at the end of the song. It is also one of the few Queen songs not to feature any vocals by Mercury, although he did perform lead vocals in live performances.\nThe band's web site states they were unaware that they were being recorded, but May has cast doubt on the authenticity of this, though has confirmed the first take of the backing track was used.",

The painting inspired the band to contact Freas, who agreed to alter the painting for their album cover, by replacing the single dead man with the four \"dead\" band members (with Mercury and May dead in the robot's hand—Mercury bleeding from his chest and blood on the robot's middle finger of its opposite hand—and with Taylor and Deacon falling to the ground, Taylor only visible on the back cover).\nThe inner cover (gatefold) has the robot extending its hand to snatch up the petrified fleeing audience in the shattered auditorium where the corpses were removed. Freas said he was a classical music fan and did not know Queen, and only listened to the band after doing the cover \"because I thought I might just hate them, and it would ruin my ideas\", but eventually liked their music.",

                "content": "News of the World initially received mixed reviews, mostly reflecting on the album's shift towards a more minimalist sound, and away from the band's previous predominantly progressive rock sound. The Washington Post commended the band's experimentation within a range of hard rock to soft rock, while Rolling Stone magazine's Bart Testa noted, \"Most of the songs on News of the World either challenge Queen's artistic enemies or endeavor to establish a vision of the new order.\" He further dismissed the album as \"the salient fictions of which today's Top Ten albums are made.\" For The Village Voice in 1977, Robert Christgau said that one side of the album is devoted to \"the futile rebelliousness of the doomed-to-life losers (those saps!) (you saps!) who buy and listen\", while the other is devoted to songs about indecent women.\nThe Daily Mirror hailed it as the \"most intriguing Queen album since their finest, Sheer Heart Attack,\" commenting that \"whether all the obvious tension within the band will spur them on, or simply pull them apart, remains to be seen.\" Although Sounds dismissed side one as \"foreboding\", they reacted positively to side two, particularly praising \"My Melancholy Blues\". The Valley News criticised it as being \"tamer\" than the band's first four albums, but concluded that \"Queen still pulls off top honors,\" particularly praising the production, Mercury's vocals and May's guitar work. In a mixed review, Record Mirror described News as \"Queen stripped down to almost basics...it's not a bad album by any means, but it could have been better.\"\nRetrospective reviews of the album have been unanimous in praise, and is now regarded as one of Queen's greatest works. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the eclecticism in comparison to \"A Day at the Races\", describing it as \"an explosion of styles that didn't seem to hold to any particular center.\" He praised May's contributions for giving the album \"some lightness\", and concluded that \"when it works, it's massive, earth-shaking rock & roll, the sound of a band beginning to revel in its superstardom.\" In Creem magazine's annual poll, readers voted News of the World as the 19th best album of 1977. BBC Music's Daryl Easlea said that the album is an exceptional showcase of \"Queen's unerring ability to sound absolutely like no-other group – even when parodying other musical styles\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune gave the album a generally positive rating, and observed that Queen had \"ventured deeper into stadium rock\", while Brendan Schroer of Sputnikmusic also noted the relation to stadium rock, calling it \"the great arena rock wonder\" with very few flaws.\nThe 40th anniversary release prompted several more reviews, with David Chiu of The Quietus calling it \"a work that had swagger and attitude\", while Loudersound wrote that \"Despite damping down their instincts so punks wouldn't spit at them, they still sound like flamboyance has burst through the wall, riding a Harley and wearing a tiara.\" Several publications have hailed it as one of the band's greatest albums. NME ranked it as the best Queen album, describing it as \"their sharpest, surest set\", while Christopher Thelen of the Daily Vault praised it for being \"the best mixture of musical styles they had ever achieved\" and Queen's \"creative peak\".",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Night_at_the_Opera_(Queen_album)",
        "summary": "A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 28 November 1975, by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was reportedly the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release.\nNamed after the Marx Brothers' film of the same name, A Night at the Opera was recorded at various studios across a four-month period in 1975. Due to management issues, Queen had received almost none of the money they earned for their previous albums. Subsequently, they ended their contract with Trident Studios and did not use their studios for the album (the sole exception being \"God Save the Queen\", which had been recorded the previous year). They employed a complex production that extensively used multitrack recording, and the songs incorporated a wide range of styles, such as ballads, music hall, sea shanties, dixieland, hard rock and progressive rock influences. Aside from their usual equipment, Queen also utilised a diverse range of instruments such as a double bass, harp, ukulele and more.\nUpon release, A Night at the Opera became Queen's first number-one album in the UK, topping the UK Albums Chart for four non-consecutive weeks. It peaked at number four on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart and became the band's first Platinum-certified album in the US. It also produced the band's most successful single in the UK, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which became their first number-one song in the country. Despite being twice as long as the average length of singles during the 1970s, the song became immensely popular worldwide.\nContemporary reviews for A Night at the Opera were positive, with praise for its production and the diverse musical themes, and recognition as the album that established Queen as worldwide superstars. At the 19th Grammy Awards, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" received Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices. It has since been hailed as Queen's best album, and one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked it number 128 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018.",

                "content": "Queen's previous album, Sheer Heart Attack (1974), had obtained commercial success and brought the band mainstream attention, with the single \"Killer Queen\" reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart. The album was a minor hit in the US, reaching number twelve, while \"Killer Queen\" hit the top 20. Despite this success, the band was broke at the time, largely due to a contract they had signed which meant that they would produce albums for a production company, who would then sell the album to a record label. This meant that Queen saw almost none of the money they earned, as Trident Studios paid them £60 weekly. Guitarist Brian May was living in a bedsit in Earls Court, West London while frontman Freddie Mercury lived in a flat in Kensington that suffered from rising damp. The matter eventually reached a turning point when bassist John Deacon, who had recently married, was denied a cash advance of £4,000 by manager Norman Sheffield to put a deposit on a house. This increasing frustration led to Mercury writing the song \"Death on Two Legs\", which would serve as the opening track to A Night at the Opera.\nIn December 1974, the band hired Jim Beach as their lawyer and began negotiating their way out of Trident. While Beach studied the group's contracts, the group continued touring. They began their first tour of Japan in April 1975, where thousands of fans met them at Haneda Airport and they played two sold out shows at the Nippon Budokan, Tokyo. After a nine-month dispute, Queen were finally free of Trident and signed directly with EMI Records in the UK and Elektra Records in North America. They regained control of their back catalogue, while their former publishing company, Feldman, was taken over by EMI. Because Trident had invested over £200,000 in promoting Queen, the group were required to pay half that to buy out their contracts, and they had to give Trident 1% royalties from their next six albums. Additionally, a tour of America scheduled for September 1975 had to be cancelled as it had been organised by Jack Nelson, who was associated with Trident, despite the already booked venues and sold tickets. This tour was necessary for regaining funds, and its cancellation was a major setback.\nWith funds running low, Queen immediately began searching for new management. Three names were shortlisted: Peter Rudge, Peter Grant, who was then Led Zeppelin's manager, and John Reid, who was Elton John's manager at the time. Rudge was on tour with the Rolling Stones and could not be reached, so they contacted Grant. Grant, who was eager to manage Queen, had intended the band would sign with Swan Song, Led Zeppelin's label, and suggested Queen go on tour while he sorted out their finances. The group feared Grant would prioritise Led Zeppelin over them, and were reluctant to sign with Swan Song, so they contacted Reid. Reid was initially doubtful about managing another band; however, he accepted after learning it was Queen, and advised the group to \"go into the studio and make the best record you can\".",

                "content": "Queen worked with producer Roy Thomas Baker, who had also split from Trident, and engineer Mike Stone. It was the last time they would work with Baker until 1978's Jazz. Gary Langan, then 19 years old and who had been a tape operator on two of Sheer Heart Attack's songs, was promoted to an assistant engineer on the album. It was reportedly the most expensive album ever made at the time, with the estimated cost being £40,000 (equivalent to £423,800 in 2023).\nThe album was recorded at seven different studios over a period of four months. Queen spent a month during the summer of 1975 rehearsing in a barn at what would become Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey. The group then had a three-week writing and rehearsing session in a rented house near Kington, Herefordshire before recording began. From August to September 1975, the group worked at Rockfield in Monmouthshire. For the remainder of recording sessions, which lasted until November, the group recorded at Lansdowne, Sarm Studios, Roundhouse, Scorpio Sound and Olympic Sound Studios. As their deal with Trident had ended, Trident Studios was not used during recording. The only song on the album recorded at Trident was \"God Save the Queen\", which had been recorded on 27 October the previous year, shortly before the band embarked on their Sheer Heart Attack Tour.\nThe group required multi-tracking for their complex vocal harmonies which typically consisted of May singing lower registers, Mercury singing middle registers and Taylor performing the higher parts (Deacon did not sing). Unlike their first three albums, which had used 16-track tape, A Night at the Opera was recorded using 24-track tape. Their vocal harmonies are particularly notable on the song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which features an elaborate opera sequence dominated by multitracked vocals. Similarly, \"The Prophet's Song\" has an a capella middle section that utilises delay on Mercury's vocals. For their self-titled \"guitar orchestrations\", May overdubbed his homemade Red Special guitar through an amplifier built by Deacon, known as the Deacy Amp, later released commercially as the \"Brian May\" amplifier by Vox. Guitar layering is one of May's distinctive techniques as a rock guitarist. He has said that the technique was developed whilst looking for a violin sound.\nAside from their usual equipment, the group used various instruments on the album. Mercury used a grand piano for most of the songs, contributing a jangle piano on \"Seaside Rendezvous\", while Taylor used a timpani and gong on \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Deacon played double bass on \"'39\" and Wurlitzer Electric Piano on \"You're My Best Friend\". In the album liner notes, May was credited to \"orchestral backdrops\" – a reference to the fact that he played a number of instruments not typically found in Queen songs. He played an acoustic guitar on \"Love of My Life\" and \"'39\", as well a harp on \"Love of My Life\", and a toy koto on \"The Prophet's Song\". The song \"Good Company\" also features May recreating a Dixieland jazz band, which was done on his Red Special.",

It contains a diverse range of influences including folk, skiffle, British camp and music hall, jazz and opera. Each member wrote at least one song: Mercury wrote five of the songs, May wrote four, and Taylor and Deacon wrote one song each. The closing track was an instrumental cover of \"God Save the Queen\", the British national anthem, for which May was credited as the arranger.\nFor their first two albums, much of Queen's songwriting combined contemporary progressive rock and heavy metal, which led to a \"Led Zeppelin meets Yes\" description of the band. Starting with Sheer Heart Attack, Queen began drawing inspiration from their everyday lives, and embraced more mainstream musical styles, a trend which A Night at the Opera would continue. Lyrical themes ranged from science fiction and fantasy to heartbreak and romance, often with a tongue in cheek sense of humour. The Winnipeg Free Press noted that the group blended \"clever, often poignant lyrics with attractively-arranged melodies\".",

                                "content": "\"Death on Two Legs\" is considered to be Mercury's hate letter to Queen's first manager, Norman Sheffield, who for some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager from 1972 to 1975. The lyrics refer to \"blood-sucking leeches\" and \"decaying sewer rats\". Though the song never makes direct reference to him, after listening to a playback of the song at Trident Studios around the time of the album's release, Sheffield sued the band and the record label for defamation, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, but also confirmed his connection to the song. Executives at EMI were unsure that the song was a good idea, May was unsure about the lyrics and felt bad that Mercury was singing it, but ultimately realised it was the songwriter's final choice as to what should be sung. As with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", most of the guitar parts on this song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to May how they needed to be played on guitar. During live performances, Mercury would usually rededicate the song to \"a real motherfucker of a gentleman\", although this line was censored on the version that appeared on their Live Killers album in 1979. Other than on the live album, he said it was dedicated to a \"motherfucker I used to know\". \"Death on Two Legs\" remained on the setlist until, and well into, The Game Tour in 1981, and was then dropped. The piano introduction was played occasionally during the Hot Space and Works tours.",

The lead vocal was sung in the studio and reproduced through headphones in a tin bucket elsewhere in the studio. A microphone picked up the sound from the bucket, which gives it a hollow \"megaphone\" sound. The guitar solo is also reported to have been recorded on the vocal track, as there were no more tracks to record on, as explained by producer Roy Thomas Baker during the Classic Albums documentary.",

The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording. Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \"love of his life\". The song is dedicated to him, with the album saying: \"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\". When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury, the writer of the first single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", to allow it to be the B-side. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the A-side did for Mercury. The song was often played live during the 1977–1981 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008. Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with the Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar.",

May sings the song on the album, with backing vocals by Mercury and Taylor. During live performances, Mercury sang the lead vocal. May had asked Deacon to play double bass as a joke but a couple of days later he found Deacon in the studio with the instrument, and he had already learned to play it. George Michael performed \"'39\" at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992. Michael cited this song as his favourite Queen song, claiming he used to busk it on the London Underground.

May played harp (doing it chord by chord and pasting the takes to form the entire part), Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar (which he had bought in Japan) and his Red Special. May eventually arranged the song so it could be played on an acoustic 12 string for live performances. \"Love of My Life\" was such a concert favourite that Mercury frequently stopped singing and allowed the audience to take over. It was especially well received during concerts in South America, and the band released the song as a single there. When Queen and Paul Rodgers performed the song (specifically Brian solo) he sang almost none of the words and let the audience sing it all, continuing the tradition. When Queen and Adam Lambert performed it, Brian would play along to a projection of Freddie singing.

The other members recorded their respective instruments with no concept of how their tracks would be utilised in the final mix.\nThe operatic section was originally intended to be only a short interlude of \"Galileos\" that connected the ballad and hard rock portions of the song. The interlude is full of \"obscure classical characters: Scaramouche, a clown from the Commedia dell'arte; astronomer Galileo; Figaro, the principal character in Beaumarchais' The Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro; and Beelzebub, identified in the Christian New Testament as Satan, Prince of Demons, but in Arabic as \"Lord of the Flies\".

The song was rereleased as a double A-side to \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" on 5 September 1991, Mercury's 45th birthday, in the US and on 9 December 1991, after Mercury's death, in the UK.",

Marx also invited Queen to visit him at his Los Angeles home in March 1977 (five months before he died). The band thanked him, and performed \"'39\" a cappella.

The band's next album, A Day at the Races, featured a similar design but on a black background.\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was released as the lead single on 31 October 1975, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as its B-side. Their management initially refused to release it; however, Kenny Everett played a copy of the song on his show 14 times, at which point audience demand for the song intensified and the band's label EMI was forced to release it. It subsequently topped the UK charts for nine weeks and peaked at number nine in the US. A second single, \"You're My Best Friend\" was released on 18 June 1976, with \"'39\" as its B-side. It reached number sixteen in the US and number seven in the UK.\nThe album was completed a week before the group were to embark on their A Night at the Opera Tour in support of the album. This resulted in a 36-hour mixing session, as the group wanted to have time to rehearse their setlist before touring.

Tony Stewart of NME opined that \"More than anything else, A Night at the Opera is a consolidation of the previous album's success in skilfully engineering this balance between artistry and effectology. Throughout the album, they display their individual songwriting abilities and musicianship to devastating effect.\" Stewart described \"Sweet Lady\" as an \"awful rock number\" which \"mars an otherwise excellent set\", and concluded, \"If it's the most expensive album ever made in a British studio, it's also arguably the best.\" In Melody Maker, Harry Doherty called the album \"easily their best work to date\" and wrote that the band had \"used studio gadgetry to the fullest effect, but they've also used it to the best advantage\". He stated that \"Queen could well set out a future direction in British rock and roll. They're hard rock, but just commercial enough to capture a massive, wide-ranging audience.\" Doherty's conclusion was that A Night at the Opera was \"with Roxy Music's Siren the best rock album I've heard this year\".\nIn Record Mirror & Disc, Ray Fox-Cumming attempted to review the album based on a single listening at the playback party held for the press, which he admitted \"isn't really enough\" to form a proper critical opinion. However, he described his first impressions of \"an amazing rush of music with one track running helter-skelter into the next ... The orchestral effects, all done by voices, are dazzling but come and go too quickly to appreciate on a solo listening.\" Fox-Cumming stated that the album had three highlights – \"Death on Two Legs\", \"The Prophet's Song\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" – and only one bad track, \"Sweet Lady\". He concluded that \"as a whole, A Night at the Opera is faster, flashier and more complex than Sheer Heart Attack, but they haven't gone over the top\". Phil Sutcliffe of Sounds reviewed the album from a cassette copy, and gave it a five-star review: \"You can feel the colossal effort that went into every second of this long album – and yet there's a hardly a moment when I would criticise it for being contrived or overproduced.\" He singled out \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song\" as the two tracks that \"make a good album extraordinary\", despite stating that the latter song's lyrics were \"not appealing\", and overall highlighting the album's \"musical range power and consistently incisive lyrics\".\nIn the US, Kris Nicholson of Rolling Stone said that although they share other heavy metal groups' penchant for \"manipulating dynamics\", Queen are an elite act in the genre and set themselves apart by incorporating \"unlikely effects: acoustic piano, harp, a capella vocals, no synthesisers. Coupled with good songs.\" Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, felt that the album \"doesn't actually botch any of a half-dozen arty-to-heavy 'eclectic' modes ... and achieves a parodic tone often enough to suggest more than meets the ear. Maybe if they come up with a coherent masterwork I'll figure out what that more is.\" The Winnipeg Free Press wrote: \"The group's potential is practically limitless, indicating that Queen is destined to finally take its place among the small handful of truly major acts working in rock today.\"",

As with many such landmark albums it became part milestone and part millstone, with every album that followed compared in some way or another to the musical and commercial success they achieved here. Be that as it may, the music is what counts – and it is simply amazing.\" Grooves noted that \"Sharp operatic interludes, abrupt rhythmic changes, A Night at the Opera defies convention and places Queen in that rarefied circle of genuine superstars.\"\nIn a 2006 review, Paul Rees of Q observed that although A Night at the Opera was \"released the same year as both Bowie's arch soul pastiche Young Americans and the sleek art rock of Roxy's Siren, it has rarely been heralded as either. Yet it was, and is, every bit as brash, bold and full of the joys of its own possibilities.\" Feeling that Queen \"never came close to bettering their fourth album\", Rees concluded that \"later albums would expose the lack of soul at the heart of Queen's music; they were all surface, no feeling. They elected themselves the great entertainers, and this heady rush of experimentation was not to be repeated. But A Night at the Opera remains glorious, monumental. It is British rock's greatest extravagance.\" In 2007, Chris Jones of BBC Music noted the diverse range of musical styles on the album, saying, \"Sheer Heart Attack had hinted at a working knowledge of 19th century parlour balladry, 20s ragtime and Jimi Hendrix. A Night at the Opera was to add opera, trad jazz, heavy metal and more to the mix.\" He concluded that the album \"remains their finest hour\".\nIn 2011, digitally remastered versions of the earlier Queen albums were released, prompting another batch of reviews. Uncut said that the album \"proved there was no limit to their capabilities\" and concluded, \"Containing not one but two monumental epics ('Bohemian Rhapsody', 'The Prophet's Song'), and gorging on grandiose gestures galore, A Night at the Opera secured itself instant classic status\". Pitchfork's Dominique Leone stated, \"No punches pulled, no expense spared: A Night at the Opera was Queen at the top of the mountain\". AJ Ramirez of PopMatters wrote, \"Kicking off with the downright ominous high-drama of 'Death on Two Legs' (a retort against the group's recently deposed management where Mercury spits out venomous invectives at the targets of his ire), the album gives way to a kaleidoscope of styles, from 1920 jazz to space-folk narratives to top-of-the-line contemporary pop-rock. Amazingly, while the transitions between genres would conceivably throw listeners for a loop, none are jarring. Instead, Queen succeeds because it pulls from all the best tricks in the library of showbiz history to deliver laughs, heartache, grandeur, and spectacle to its audience at precisely the right moments.\" He observed that \"it is the realization of such a unique sonic vision that pushes [the album] into the realm of true excellence ... A Night at the Opera stands as a breathtaking, involving creation, and unequivocally Queen's finest album.\"",

        "summary": "Queen is the debut studio album by the British rock band Queen. Released on 13 July 1973 by EMI Records in the UK and by Elektra Records in the US, it was recorded at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea Music Centre, London, with production by Roy Thomas Baker, John Anthony and the band members themselves.\nThe album combines heavy metal and progressive rock with a folk influence. The lyrics are based on a variety of topics, including folklore (\"My Fairy King\") and religion (\"Jesus\"). Lead singer Freddie Mercury wrote five of the ten tracks, lead guitarist Brian May wrote four songs (including \"Doing All Right\", which he co-wrote with Tim Staffell while in the band Smile), and drummer Roger Taylor both wrote and sang \"Modern Times Rock and Roll\". The final song on the album is a short instrumental version of \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", the full version of which would appear on the band's second album, Queen II.\nThe album was rereleased as a remixed, remastered and expanded box set entitled Queen I Collector's Edition on 25 October 2024.",

                "content": "Queen, who played their first gig in the City Hall of Truro on 27 June 1970, had been playing the club and college circuit in and around London for almost two years when they were asked to test out the new recording facilities at De Lane Lea Studios. The band came away with a polished demo tape of five songs: \"Keep Yourself Alive\", \"The Night Comes Down\", \"Great King Rat\", \"Jesus\", and \"Liar\". The group sent their demo to various record labels, but received only one offer: a low bid from Charisma Records, which they declined as, according to their friend Ken Testi, they feared they \"would always play second fiddle to Genesis and those other bands\".\nProducers John Anthony and Roy Thomas Baker visited De Lane Lea while the band were recording and were impressed by what they saw. They recommended Queen to Barry and Norman Sheffield, who owned Trident Studios. The Sheffield brothers arranged for Queen to record at Trident; however, because the studio was very popular, Queen mainly recorded during studio downtime but were given free use of everything after the paying artists had left, including the latest technologies and production team. Trident also agreed to oversee the group's management, recording and publishing interests while they sought a record deal. One day, while waiting to use the studio, Freddie Mercury was asked to record vocals by producer Robin Geoffrey Cable, who was working on a version of \"I Can Hear Music\" and \"Goin' Back\". Mercury enlisted May and Taylor on the tracks, which were released on a single under the name Larry Lurex, a parody of Gary Glitter.",

                "content": "The process of recording only during studio downtime—late evenings or overnight—lasted from April to July 1972. Roger Taylor recalled, \"You could see the working girls at night through their laced curtains, so while we were mixing, we would have a little bit of diversion\". The limitations of this arrangement led the band to focus on completing one track at a time, but problems arose almost immediately. The band had thought highly of their De Lane Lea demo tracks, but producer Roy Thomas Baker had them re-record the songs with better equipment. \"Keep Yourself Alive\" was the first song to be re-recorded, and Queen did not like the result. They recorded it again, but no mix met their standards. After seven or eight failed attempts, engineer Mike Stone stepped in, and his first try met with Queen's approval. Stone would stay on to engineer and eventually co-produce their next five albums. May later commented that \"Between Roy [Thomas Baker] and I, we were fighting the whole time to find a place where we had the perfection but also the reality of performance and sound\".\nAnother track that proved problematic was \"Mad the Swine\", which was to be the fourth track on the album between \"Great King Rat\" and \"My Fairy King\". Baker and Queen disagreed over the drum sound and percussion, and it was left off the album. It re-surfaced in 1991, remixed by David Richards, as both the B-side to the \"Headlong\" CD single in the UK, and on the Hollywood Records re-release of the album.\nOther songs known to have been recorded in this period are \"Polar Bear\" (an old Smile song by May & Staffell) and \"Now That I'm Here\" (also by May, later reworked into \"Feelings, Feelings\" for the News of the World sessions). Other unconfirmed songs claimed to have been recorded during these sessions are \"Hangman\" (alternatively \"Waiting for the Hangman\" or \"Hangman Blues\") by Mercury, and \"Rock'n'Roll Medley\" (a medley of covers including \"Jailhouse Rock\") and \"Silver Salmon\" by Staffell, (also confirmed to have also been recorded during the News of the World sessions, at an unknown date in Summer of 1977). It is also likely that songs from Queen's next album, Queen II, and third album, Sheer Heart Attack, were also recorded for this album but saved for later projects and subsequently rerecorded.",

Mercury borrowed some lines from Robert Browning's poem \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\". The song was written while the band were in the studio, and contains many vocal overdubbed harmonies, which Mercury was fond of. Roger Taylor also displays his high vocal range, hitting the highest notes in the composition. The vocal overdubs technique would later be used in many Queen songs, most notably \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".\nBrian May said that after the lyric \"Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me\" was written, Mercury claimed he was singing about his own mother. Subsequently, Freddie Bulsara took the stage name Freddie Mercury. This was another attempt to separate him from his stage persona. As Mercury once explained, \"When I'm performing I'm an extrovert, yet inside I'm a completely different man.\"\n\"My Fairy King\" is the first song on the album to feature Mercury's piano skills – as the piano on \"Doing All Right\" was played by May, who was quite impressed by Mercury's piano playing on the track. From this point on Mercury handled most of Queen's piano parts.",

It was first recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in January 1972, when the band were hired to test the studio's new equipment in exchange for being allowed to record proper demos for their attempt to find a label.\nIn 1972, Trident Studios signed Queen to a recording contract, but limited them to work only during studio down-time. They began working with Roy Thomas Baker who, along with owners/management Norman and Barry Sheffield, insisted on re-recording the five De Lane Lea demos. A new version of \"The Night Comes Down\" was recorded, but the band were unsatisfied with the results and the original demo was used on the album. With the release of the original De Lane Lea demos as bonus tracks in 2011, the difference in the mix of \"The Night Comes Down\" is quite noticeable when compared to the original LP and digital remasters. The demo is roughly the same mix that appeared on the album except for a distinct difference in the drum sound.\nThe song follows what would become trademark May themes such as coming-of-age, nostalgia over the loss of childhood, and the difficulties of adult life. There is also what could be an ambiguous reference to the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", in the lyric: \"When I was young it came to me; And I could see the sun breaking; Lucy was high and so was I; Dazzling, holding the world inside.\" May is a Beatles fan and has commented in numerous interviews on their impact on him.",

The first dates from December 1973 and was broadcast on John Peel's show. This version was eventually released on the 1989 Queen album At The Beeb, and sounds similar to the album version. The second re-recording dates from April 1974 and was first broadcast on Bob Harris's show. The later version, only available on bootleg recordings prior to the release of On Air, differs from the original album version in its slower tempo and additional vocals from Mercury.\nIn the concert versions included in Live at the Rainbow '74, Mercury handled lead vocals.",

The song was played in the very first concert under the name of Queen in 1970. It was a regular feature in Queen's live set until well into 1976. The song originally housed his famous guitar solo, but the album version does not feature the solo. The solo would not be properly recorded until 1974, with \"Brighton Rock\" from Sheer Heart Attack. Until this time, and occasionally afterward, the guitar solo would take over the middle of \"Son and Daughter\" during concerts, allowing the rest of the band a bit of a rest and costume change.\nUnlike other songs from Queen's early period which crept back into circulation in the live set of their 1984–86 tours, such as \"Liar\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" and \"In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited\", \"Son and Daughter\" stayed off the setlists after Queen's hit singles began to dominate their live show. The song is indicative of their very earliest sound, influenced by blues rock and heavy metal.",

After eight months of failing that, they took the initiative and released it themselves in a license deal with EMI Records on 13 July 1973. During this time, Queen had begun writing material for their next album, but they were disheartened by the album's delay, feeling they had grown past that stage, even though the record-buying public was just getting wind of them. They recorded two BBC sessions during the interim. The first single, \"Keep Yourself Alive\" (the Mike Stone mix, now considered the standard album version), was released a week before the album (UK dates, 6 and 13 July respectively). The US single was issued in October. By mid-January 1974, \"Keep Yourself Alive\" was getting airplay on U.S. progressive radio stations, according to Radio & Records playlist information printed at the time. All countries had the B-side \"Son and Daughter\". The album was released in the US on 4 September.\nElektra Records released a single of \"Liar\" in a heavily edited form on 14 February 1974, with the B-side \"Doing All Right\". Elektra later reissued the edited version of \"Keep Yourself Alive\" in July 1975, this time with a double B-side of \"Lily of the Valley\" and \"God Save the Queen\". Both versions are different from the album versions.\nHollywood Records released a CD single featuring five versions of \"Keep Yourself Alive\" to promote the forthcoming Crown Jewels box set (1998). The versions on the CD are \"Long Lost Re-take\", \"BBC Session No. 1 Version\", \"Live Killers Version\", \"Album Version (Unremastered)\", and \"Album Version (1998 Remastered Version)\".",

Their debut album is superb.\" The Winnipeg Free Press opined that Queen borrowed from other artists, but also compared the album favourably to Led Zeppelin, writing, \"the band manages to inject such a fresh, energetic touch to most of it that I don't mind a bit... With its first album, Queen has produced a driving, high energy set which in time may be looked upon with the same reverence Led Zep 1 now receives.\" Illinois' Daily Herald also commended the record, writing \"Good listening is guaranteed in songs like 'Keep Yourself Alive', 'Great King Rat' and 'Doing All Right'.\"\nIn later years, AllMusic awarded the album three out of five stars, calling it a \"patchy but promising debut from a classic rock group\". In 1994, Guitarist Magazine ranked Queen the 19th most influential guitar album of all time. The album placed at number 54 in NME's \"100 Greatest Albums You've Never Heard\" in 2011. In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked \"Keep Yourself Alive\" number 31 in the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\", describing it as \"an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song\". It has also been cited as heavy metal journalist Martin Popoff's favorite record of all time. In a Chicago Tribune article written by Greg Kot, the album is given a generally positive rating overall, complimenting the band's heavy sound combined with baroque arrangements.\nWriting for Classic Rock in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked Queen as the band's second greatest album. He described it as a \"glorious hard rock marathon unlike anything else around at the time\", and commented on the \"unmistakably unique sound of Brian May's home-made guitar\", the \"panoramic production of Roy Thomas Baker\" and the \"soaring voice of Freddie Mercury\", adding \"the record was just too powerful, too multi-dimensional and too stunning to sit happily and contentedly in the grooves. The performances were all virtuoso.\"",

This expansion contains 63 tracks with 43 brand new mixes, comprising the album with its intended running order restored, intimate fly-on-the-wall audio of Queen in the studio, alternative takes, demos, rare live tracks, and previously unheard live recordings. This is also the first time a Queen album has received a new stereo mix. A 108-page book containing handwritten lyrics and memorabilia accompanies the release. This will be the band's last reissue under Universal Music, as Sony Music acquired Queen's catalogue in 2024.\nThe first single of the box set, the 2024 mix of \"The Night Comes Down\", was released in conjunction with the announcement on 11 September, with an official music video premiering on YouTube on 13 September that year. The music video received mostly negative appraisal from the internet audience due to artificial intelligence used to generate the video. On 11 October, the new mix of \"Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll\" was released as a digital single. A special re-edited and restored edition of the \"Keep Yourself Alive\" promo video was released in conjunction with the boxset on 25 October.\nThe new 2024 mix includes \"Mad the Swine\", reinstated as the album's fourth song in-between \"Great King Rat\" and \"My Fairy King\". Previously unreleased material includes live versions of the song \"Jesus\", the first time a live version of the song has been heard, and a cover of the Bo Diddley written blues standard \"I'm a Man\", both from Queen's second ever concert in London at Imperial College on 23 August 1970, also bassist Barry Mitchell's first performance with the band. The box set also includes the first official release of the song \"Hangman\" in a live version from Queen's concert at the San Diego Sports Arena on 12 March 1976, in one of its final live performances. Queen says a studio version does not exist, but the song was performed live sporadically from 1970 to the Japanese A Night at the Opera tour in 1976.",

        "summary": "Queen II is the second studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 8 March 1974 by EMI Records in the UK and \nElektra Records in the US. It was recorded at Trident Studios and Langham 1 Studios, London, in August 1973 with co-producers Roy Thomas Baker and Robin Geoffrey Cable, and engineered by Mike Stone. It is significant for being the first album to contain many elements of the band's signature sound of multi-layered overdubs, vocal harmonies, and varied musical styles.\nDescribed as \"arguably the heaviest Queen album\", Queen II marked the end of the first phase of the band's career. The album combines a heavy rock sound with art rock and progressive rock elements, and has been called \"a pillar of grandiose, assaultive hard rock\" by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Queen II is not a concept album but a collection of songs with a loose theme running throughout. The two sides of the original LP were labelled \"Side White\" and \"Side Black\" (instead of the conventional sides A and B), with corresponding photos of the band dressed in black on the front cover and white on the inner gatefold. The white side has songs with a more emotional theme and the black side is almost entirely about fantasy, often with quite dark themes. Mick Rock's cover photograph was frequently re-used by the band throughout its career, including the music videos for the songs \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (1975) and \"One Vision\" (1985).\nReleased to an initially mixed critical reception, Queen II remains one of the band's lesser-known albums. Nonetheless, it has retained a cult following since its release, and garnered praise from critics, fans, and fellow musicians alike.",

                "content": "Queen performed their first gig on 27 June 1970, but did not finish their self-titled debut album, Queen, until November 1972. In the interim, the band had developed other, more complex material but elected to wait to record it until they had more freedom and experience in the studio. \"Father To Son\", \"Ogre Battle\" and \"Procession\" had all been premiered as early as 1972. \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" dated to Freddie Mercury's Wreckage days in 1969. \"See What a Fool I've Been\", the B-side to the \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" single and \"White Queen (As It Began)\" were left over from the Smile days. \"Stone Cold Crazy\", also from Mercury's Wreckage period, had been in the set list for years, but was held back and reworked for the third album, Sheer Heart Attack. Portions of \"The Prophet's Song\" were also rehearsed during the Queen II sessions, but the song was not completed until the fourth album, A Night at the Opera. Queen insisted that Trident Studios allow them to record at regular hours instead of studio down-time, as they had for the first album. The band approached David Bowie to produce, but he declined because he was then recording Pin Ups and working on songs for Diamond Dogs. Robin Geoffrey Cable, with whom Mercury had worked during the \"I Can Hear Music\" session, was asked to produce \"Nevermore\" and \"Funny How Love Is\", and collaborate with Roy Thomas Baker on the ambitious \"March of the Black Queen\".\nAfter the commercial failure of the single \"Keep Yourself Alive\" from the first album, Queen decided it needed a single that did not take \"too long to happen\" (i.e., without a lengthy guitar intro). \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", recorded with the specific intention of being the album's leading single, began in a way designed to grab attention. Rehearsals for the Queen II sessions commenced on or around 26 July. (Due to management problems, the first album was finally released as the band prepared to record Queen II.) During these rehearsals, the band were interviewed by Melody Maker and told the magazine that their new album would have a theme of \"good versus evil\". The band also ended its collaboration with John Anthony, who had co-produced the first album, due to clashes between Mercury and Anthony. On 3 August, the band performed at a gig in Newcastle, then returned to London for a pre-recording rehearsal on 4 August. Sessions began on 5 August with takes 1–12 of the finished version of \"Seven Seas of Rhye\". On 6 August, they started recording \"Father To Son\", working on takes 1–4. They continued to work on the album until 9 August, when they made promotional videos for \"Keep Yourself Alive\" and \"Liar\" from the debut album.\nAccording to the August 11 issue of Record Mirror, the band was scheduled to go back into the studio on 15 August. However, David Bowie and Ken Scott were producing Pin Ups in the studio Queen had been using. The band were put into Studio 2, with producer Robin Geoffrey Cable. Although this studio only had an 8-track tape machine at the time, Queen decided to work on backing tracks nonetheless. Takes of Nevermore were recorded that day, and Funny How Love Is was recorded on 16 August. Queen had to cancel a studio session on 17 August to perform a gig in Peterborough. They returned to London around 3:00 a.m. Roy Thomas Baker had also left (around 12–18 August) to work with a Danish client named Gasolin', who were recording their album Gasolin' 3. On 18 August, Queen, Baker and Cable recorded the complex backing track for \"The March Of The Black Queen\". After taking a break for a bank holiday, the band began principal overdubbing on 28 August. Some backing tracks had to be cut into separate multi-tracks because of the extensive overdubbing. (The album's working title became \"Over The Top\" in reference to overdubbing.) During this period, John Deacon had to do his summer exams. In September, Brian recorded \"Procession,\" which had its live premiere on 13 September when the band played at the Golders Green Hippodrome in London. (This was also their first recorded concert.)\nOn 24 September, the band did their first radio interview with Bob Harris. In early October, Queen met with photographer Mick Rock for the first time to discuss album concept art. They took a short break starting on 12 October to begin a promotional tour around Europe. On 18 October, the band returned to London to continue work on the album. On 3 November, Queen had their first publicity shoot with Mick Rock, producing the album's iconic cover image. Queen took another break from recording in November to tour with Mott The Hoople. Rehearsals began on 5 November and the tour started in Blackburn on 13 November. The band would come near London a few times in early December, and popped into the studio on their days off. The tour ended at the Hammersmith Odeon on 14 December, followed by a standalone gig at Leicester University on 15 December. Rough mixing for the album commenced on 17 December. Martin Hayman of Sounds visited the band on 22 December while they were finishing rough mixes for \"Loser In The End\", \"Ogre Battle\", and \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\".\nQueen went back into the studio in early January. At this point, all of the rough mixes had been finished, and the band were ready to move onto the final stages of production. According to studio documentation, most of the songs were mixed by 19 January, but still required equalization. Brian had also contracted gangrene from a tainted inoculation needle in mid-December, and couldn't attend some sessions. The band flew to Australia on 25 January and performed to an unruly crowd on 27 January that led to the band to storm off stage halfway through their set. On 31 January, Queen returned to London to complete the album. The last pressings were made on 20 February.",

Music journalist and author Jerry Ewing described the album as displaying a \"proggy art rock tendency\". Daniel Ross of The Quietus described it as \"the exact intersection\" between the band's \"murky, metallic beginnings\" and \"the absolute pop perfection incarnation of Queen, leather trousers and Formby pastiches.\" The band included the comment \"and nobody played synthesiser... again\" on the album sleeve, a purist principle of May's, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate multi-tracking and effects, produced by guitar and vocals, as synthesisers.\nRather than the conventional Side 1 and Side 2, the album was split into \"Side White\" and \"Side Black\", dominated by May and Mercury compositions respectively. Although some have interpreted it as a concept album, Queen biographer Georg Purvis stated that it is \"not a concept album but a collection of songs with a loose theme running throughout.\" Mercury later confirmed this in a 1976 Sounds interview, citing that \"it just evolved to where there was a batch of songs that could be considered aggressive, or a Black Side, and there was a smoother side\".\nThe \"White\" side is very diverse: four of the five numbers were composed by Brian May, one of which is an instrumental.

The band waited until they could have more studio freedom to do it properly.\nThe song is one of Queen's heaviest works. The guitar riff and Taylor's drumming give it a very \"thrash\" sound. The ogre-like screams in the middle are Mercury's, and the high harmonies at the end of the chorus hook are sung by Taylor. As the title suggests, it tells the story of a battle between ogres, and features a May guitar solo and sound effects to simulate the sounds of a battle. The opening of the song is actually the end of the song played in reverse.\nA version of \"Ogre Battle\" was recorded in December 1973 for the BBC Radio 1 Sound of the 70s programme. An acetate was made of an edited version of the BBC recording without the long intro or any of the sound effects in the album version, potentially for release as a second single. However, other sources state that \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" was also considered for the second single.\n\"Ogre Battle\" was a staple of the band's live set up to and including the A Day at the Races Tour, and was only played a couple more times on the North American leg of the News of the World Tour before being dropped from the set for good.",

The fantasy-based lyrics make direct reference to characters and vignettes detailed in the painting and in Dadd's companion poem, Elimination of a Picture & its Subject—called The Feller's Master Stroke. Characters include Queen Mab, Waggoner Will, the Tatterdemalion, and others. The use of the word \"quaere\" in the twice-repeated line \"What a quaere fellow\" has no reference to Mercury's sexuality, according to Roger Taylor.\nIn some markets the album included a fold-out cover with a reproduction of the painting. Author Neil Gaiman wrote about the painting and the album on his blog:\n\nReason tells me that I would have first encountered the painting itself, the enigmatically titled \"Fairy Feller's Master Stroke,\" reproduced, pretty much full-sized, in the fold-out cover of a Queen album, at the age of fourteen or thereabouts, and it made no impression upon me at all. That's one of the odd things about it. You have to see it in the flesh, paint on canvas, the real thing, which hangs, mostly, when it isn't travelling, in the Pre-Raphaelite room of the Tate Gallery, out of place among the grand gold-framed Pre-Raphaelite beauties, all of them so much more huge and artful than the humble fairy court walking through the daisies, for it to become real. And when you see it several things will become apparent; some immediately, some eventually. Gaiman wrote a longer essay about the painting for Intelligent Life.\nFor the intricately arranged studio recording, Mercury played harpsichord as well as piano, and Roy Thomas Baker played the castanets. Taylor called this song Queen's \"biggest stereo experiment\", referring to the use of panning in the mix.\nThe song was performed only a few times during the Queen II Tour, and there was thought to be no live recording of the song until 2014, when it was released on Live at the Rainbow '74.",

I wanted to give it everything, to be self-indulgent or whatever.\" The multifaceted composition, the band's second longest (6:34), is one of two Queen songs (the other being \"Bohemian Rhapsody\") containing polyrhythm/polymeter (two different time signatures simultaneously 8/8 and 12/8) and a simpler polyrhythm around the end uptempo section, which is very rare for popular music. The lead vocals cover two and a half octaves (G2 – C5).\nMay regards it as a precursor to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", stating, \"You've got to bear in mind that we'd already made 'My Fairy King' on the first album and we'd done 'The March of the Black Queen' on the second album, so we were well in tune with Freddie's excursions into strange areas, and that was something that we really enjoyed.\" Taylor recalled in a 1977 interview, \"The tape went transparent, genuinely... It was 16-track... The tape had gone over the (recording) head so many times, overdubbing, that the oxide had worn off.\" A similar anecdote is told about the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" sessions.\nDespite never being released as a single, it remains a favourite amongst Queen's fans. The full piece was too complicated to be performed live; however, the uptempo section containing the lines \"My life is in your hands, I'll foe and I'll fie...\" etc. was sometimes included in a live medley, with vocals by Mercury and Taylor, during the 1970s. The opening piano piece is only known to have been played live once, at Providence Civic Center on 14 November 1978 (likely in response to a fan shouting for the song near the beginning of the concert). After playing the intro the band quickly transitioned into \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". This was also the final time a Queen II track would be played live until the revival of \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" in 1984 for The Works Tour.\nThis song ends with an ascending note progression, which climaxes in the first second of the following track. The song segues into the next track, \"Funny How Love Is\".",

In the documentary Queen: Days of Our Lives, May recalled, \"I've probably never spoken about this before, ever, but I remember 'Seven Seas of Rhye' being—it was Freddie's idea. He had this lovely little riff idea on the piano, and I think all the middle eighth is stuff that I did. So we definitely worked on it together. But when it came to the album coming out, Freddie went, 'I wrote that.' And we all went, 'Okay.' [laughs] Because it didn't seem like that big a deal. But Freddie said, 'You know, I wrote the words and it was my idea, so it's my song.' The sort of unwritten law was the person who brought the song in would get the credit for writing that song, and the money for writing that song. Much, much later in Queen history, we recognized this fact.\"\nAlong with \"Lily of the Valley\" from Sheer Heart Attack, the song references a fantasy world or kingdom named Rhye. \"It's really fictitious,\" Mercury told interviewer Tom Browne in 1977. \"It's a figment of your imagination.\" A short, instrumental version of \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" was included as the outro on their first album, with the intent of starting this album with the full version. A similar idea occurred with the old music hall song \"I Do Like To Be Beside the Seaside\", which is sung at the end of \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" here and whistled during the intro to the third album, Sheer Heart Attack. Ken Testi recalled, \"I joined in on the reprise at the end of 'Seven Seas of Rhye'. So did Pat McConnell and a whole bunch of us. I recall an awful lot of reverb, and Brian played the stylophone on it, but it was done in one day and we were all totally pissed at the time.\"\n\"Seven Seas of Rhye\" features a distinctive arpeggiated piano introduction. On the Queen II recording, the arpeggios are played with both hands, an octave apart, whereas on the abbreviated Queen recording, and most live performances, Mercury played the simpler one-handed version of these arpeggios. The theme also appears at the end of \"It's a Beautiful Day (reprise)\" on the band's final album Made in Heaven (1995).",

In Rock's words, the band wanted to \"graft some of [the trademark] decadent 'glam' sensibility\" of his previous work with artists such as David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. According to Rock, Queen were looking to grab people's attention with the cover, especially since their first album had failed to do so. \"They realised that if you could catch people's eyes you could get them interested in the music.\"\nThe brief he received from the band conceived a black and white theme for the album. The cover features a photograph described by VH1 as \"Queen standing in diamond formation, heads tilted back like Easter Island statues\" against a black background. The iconic chiaroscuro image of Queen was inspired by a similar photograph of Marlene Dietrich from the 1932 film Shanghai Express. \"And of course no one was ever more 'glam' than the divine Ms Dietrich,\" Rock quipped. \"It was just one of those flashes of inspiration that happens sometimes,\" Rock explained. \"There was a feeling that [echoing the Dietrich pose] might be pretentious,\" but Rock convinced the band otherwise. \"It made them look like much bigger a deal than they were at the time, but it was a true reflection of their music.\" Rock stated Mercury loved to quote Oscar Wilde. \"Often, that which today is considered pretentious is tomorrow considered state of the art. The important thing is to be considered.\" Rock added, \"To Freddie, that word [pretentious] was meaningless – 'But is it fabulous?' was all that mattered. Those were the days of androgyny, and Freddie was prepared to push it quite a way\". Freddie added, \"It doesn't have any special meaning, but we were fascinated with this type of thing, and the wardrobe we used at the time described it perfectly well\". The image would later be brought to life for the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" music video.\nTo expand on the black and white theme, Rock made a second image of the band, dressed in white against a white background, that was used in the album's gatefold, advertising, and the \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" single sleeve.",

Once again, however, EMI delayed the album's release since the first album had only just been issued in the UK and had yet to be released in the US. Other problems beset the album's release: the energy conservation measures put in place during the 1973 oil crisis delayed its manufacture by several months; then, when released, John Deacon was credited as \"Deacon John\", and the band insisted it had to be corrected.\nQueen II was released on 8 March 1974. The album enjoyed chart success in the UK, peaking at number five. It peaked at number 49 in the US, improving on their debut album Queen, which peaked at number 83. In interviews the group promoted the album with a theme of \"good versus evil,\" and made numerous public appearances to gain exposure: aside from touring in 1973, they performed BBC specials, broadcast a gig at Golders Green Hippodrome on In Concert and appeared on John Peel's Sound of the Seventies. However, despite the publicity, the group received negative reviews from the media, who criticised the band for being \"excessive and self indulgent.\"\n\"Seven Seas of Rhye\", along with the non-album B-side \"See What a Fool I've Been\", was released as a single sooner than planned due to a fortuitous circumstance. In February 1974, David Bowie was unable to appear on the show \"Top of the Pops\" to perform \"Rebel Rebel\", and a replacement act was urgently needed. Queen were booked for the show and lip-synched \"Seven Seas of Rhye\". EMI then rushed the single into release on 22 February, just five days after the television appearance was confirmed.

Along with the Queen albums Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera, Queen II is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, where it is described as \"a distinctly dark album\" which \"displayed their diversity,\" and contrasted with their later \"expansive, stadium-pleasing anthems.\"\nAllMusic awarded the album 4/5 stars and said, \"Queen is coiled, tense, and vicious here, delivering on their inherent sense of drama, and that gives Queen II real power as music, as well as a true cohesion\". The review observed the album's heaviness and stated \"this never feels as fantastical as Genesis or Uriah Heep\", concluding \"Queen II is one of the favorites of their hardcore fans\". Pitchfork awarded the album a very positive rating of 8/10, writing, \"Dizzying, overstuffed, and unflinching, Queen II is a die-hard fan favorite, and arguably the band's most underrated record.\" In 2009, The Quietus published an article highlighting Queen's \"lesser-known brilliance\" to coincide with the release of that year's Absolute Greatest compilation, describing Queen II as \"an absolute scorcher of an album\" which features two of the band's best tracks: \"Ogre Battle\" and \"Father to Son\". In 2014, Brian Moore wrote for Houston Press that \"the music is more progressive and the harmonies more advanced than anything from the first album. Queen had so exhausted themselves with the progressive rock style after recording this album that they abandoned the sound entirely for the next one.\" Writing for Classic Rock in 2016, Malcolm Dome ranked Queen II as the band's sixth greatest album. He wrote: \"Stylistically there was nothing here that wasn't on the superior debut, and you can hear the band struggling with the traditional 'difficult second album' problems... They had pushed their rock and metal roots as far as they could, and were clearly looking to jump off the train and expand their horizons. It's probably for this reason that the album lacked the sparkle and bite of Queen and the audacity of the subsequent Sheer Heart Attack.\" Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune offered a plain favourable rating of 2 stars, commenting the album \"fused Led Zeppelin's metallic stomp with Yes' baroque arrangements and topped it off with a dash of campiness.\"\nOther rock musicians have praised the album. Rob Halford of Judas Priest cited Queen II as one of his favourite albums, saying it is \"nothing but good songs\" and stating \"Ogre Battle\" as a particular favourite. In a 1989 Rolling Stone interview, Guns N' Roses lead singer Axl Rose said of the album, \"With Queen, I have my favorite: Queen II. Whenever their newest record would come out and have all these other kinds of music on it, at first I'd only like this song or that song. But after a period of time listening to it, it would open my mind up to so many different styles. I really appreciate them for that. That's something I've always wanted to be able to achieve\". Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx expressed his admiration for the album in the same publication, saying \"Queen II will knock your dick in the dirt every time\". Smashing Pumpkins lead singer Billy Corgan spoke to Melody Maker in August 1993 about \"the records which changed his life,\" stating, \"I worked at this record store where we had lots of old records, and I found Queen II, probably their least popular album. It's so over the top, so many vocal and guitar track overdubs – total Queen overload. I loved it. I loved the cool, weird, ambiguous songs about Freddie's sexuality and the way it shifts from heavy to beautiful ballads.\"",

But we were fascinated with these types of things... the wardrobe that we used at the time described it perfectly well...\nThe most important thing to me was the Queen II album going into the charts – especially satisfying that, since the first one didn't do so well. It's nice to see some recognition for your work though I don't usually worry too much. Roger tends to worry more about what's happening on that side.\nThat's when we first really got into production, and went completely over the top.\nI hated the title of the second album, Queen II, it was so unimaginative.\nWhen Queen II came out it didn't connect with everyone. A lot of people thought we'd forsaken rock music. They said: \"Why don't you play things like 'Liar' and 'Keep Yourself Alive?'\" All we could say was, give it another listen, it's there, but it's all layered, it's a new approach. Nowadays people say: \"Why don't you play like Queen II?\" A lot of our close fans think that, and I still like that album a lot. It's not perfect, it has the imperfections of youth and the excesses of youth, but I think that was our biggest single step ever.",

Departing from the progressive themes featured on their first two albums, the album featured more pop-centric and conventional rock tracks and marked a step towards the \"classic\" Queen sound. It was produced by the band and Roy Thomas Baker, and launched Queen to mainstream popularity in the UK and throughout the world.\nThe album's first single \"Killer Queen\" reached number two on the UK singles chart and provided the band with their first top 20 hit in the US, peaking at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sheer Heart Attack was the first Queen album to hit the US top 20, peaking at number 12 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape Chart in 1975.

After touring extensively throughout the UK, the two groups decided to tour together in the US, marking Queen's first tour in the country. The bands would remain on friendly terms for the rest of their career, with Ian Hunter performing \"All the Young Dudes\" at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Queen played their first US show on 16 April 1974 in Denver, Colorado, as a support, which Freddie Mercury reportedly disliked, saying: \"Being support is one of the most traumatic experiences of my life\". At the climax of the tour in Boston, Brian May was discovered to have hepatitis, possibly from the use of a contaminated needle during vaccinations the group received before travelling to Australia. The remainder of the tour was subsequently cancelled and Queen flew back home, where May was hospitalised.\nIn June, the band gathered together at Trident Studios to start rehearsing material for the album. Koh Hasebe interviewed Mercury, Roger Taylor and John Deacon when they were rehearsing on 13 June. At the beginning of July, May joined them for rehearsals. The band were just preparing to record, and on 7 July, they trekked three and a half hours to get to the Rockfield Studios in Wales, where they would record ten backing tracks, finishing on 28 July. At the start of August, work shifted to Wessex Sound Studios. Work there would not last long, however, as May, who was starting to feel uneasy, went to a specialist clinic on 2 August. He collapsed at the clinic, as a result of a duodenal ulcer, and would be operated on the following day, but discharged from the hospital soon after so he could recover at home. While the band were overdubbing at Wessex, May booked studio time at AIR Studios, where he recorded \"Dear Friends\" and \"She Makes Me\". In the meantime, Taylor and Deacon made an appearance at an EMI/Radio Luxembourg motor rally at Brands Hatch on 11 August. By late August, May was working with the band again, and the rest of the band would add their parts to the songs he had recorded. There was still one song that needed to be recorded as the band worked into September, and that was \"Now I'm Here\". They recorded the backing track for this one at Wessex, and saved the rest to be completed during the mixing sessions.\nMixing commenced in the middle of September. The band were still overdubbing at this point, so they hired someone to deliver tapes from recording studio to mixing studio via motorcycle. The heart of the mixing sessions took place at Trident Studios, and one or two days was spent mixing each of the majority of the songs. \"Brighton Rock\", on the other hand, took four days to mix, with six hours' worth of different mixes created during that time. Each song was mixed in little edited sections that were about fifteen to twenty seconds in length. At this point, Trident had just installed a 24-track machine in their studio that had been around since 1972, but was not functioning until 1974. In fact, the album was Trident's first 24-track project. Even though Trident had expanded their recording flexibility by eight tracks, this was still not enough to be able to mix each track individually. \"Bring Back That Leroy Brown\", for example, had 70 vocal tracks and had to be mixed down to work with the 24-track mixer.\nOn 20 September, it was announced the band were attempting to secure a release date for the album of 1 November, though it seemed unlikely that they would be finished in time to meet that deadline. They mixed \"Now I'm Here\", which was the last thing to be mixed, on 22 October. May did an interview the next day (which was published on 26 October) that explained what finishing the album was like. In total, the band used four different studios in the making of Sheer Heart Attack: most of the backing tracks were recorded at Rockfield, two backing tracks and some guitar overdubs were recorded at AIR Studios, most of the overdubs and one backing track were recorded at Wessex, and the mixing was done at Trident.",

As it included the first song written by John Deacon that Queen recorded (\"Misfire\") alongside tracks written by the other members of the band, Sheer Heart Attack was the first of the group's albums to contain at least one song written by each member; \"Stone Cold Crazy\" was the band's first song for which all four members shared the writing credit.",

Lyrically, it tells the story of two young lovers named Jenny and Jimmy, who meet in Brighton on a public holiday. Mods travelling to Brighton on bank holidays was a popular narrative at the time, as in the Who's Quadrophenia.\nThe song includes a three-minute unaccompanied guitar solo interlude, which makes extensive use of delay to build up guitar harmony and contrapuntal melodic lines. It grew out of May's experimentation with an Echoplex unit while he attempted to recreate his guitar orchestrations for live performances of \"Son and Daughter\". He had made modifications to the original unit so he could change the delay times, and ran each echo through a separate amplifier to avoid interference.\nThe studio version of the solo only contains one \"main\" guitar and one \"echoed\" guitar for a short section, but, live, May would usually split his guitar signal into one \"main\" and two \"echoed\" guitars, with each going to a separate bank of amplifiers. In concert, the solo has been performed as part of \"Brighton Rock\", in a medley with another song, or as a standalone piece. For example, May performed some of it at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Considered one of May's finest solos, Guitar World ranked it No. 41 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time.\nAt the very start of this song you can hear the sound of a Carousel. This was taken from a sound effects album called \"Authentic Sound Effects Volume 1\"  originally released in 1960.",

No band member was able to remember who had written the lyrics when the album was released, so they shared the writing credit, the first of their songs to do so. The lyrics deal with gangsters and include a reference to Al Capone. The track has a fast tempo and heavy distortion, presaging speed metal. Music magazine Q described \"Stone Cold Crazy\" as \"thrash metal before the term was invented\", although this was not the first song in the style of \"proto-thrash\", with Deep Purple's \"Hard Lovin' Man\" predating it by four years. The song was played live at almost every Queen concert between 1974 and 1978 and also in the cut version during European leg of The Works Tour in 1984.\nMetallica covered the song as their contribution to the 1990 compilation album Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary. This cover version won a Grammy Award in 1991; it also appeared on the band's compilation Garage Inc.",

May plays a short section on ukulele-banjo, and Deacon plays a line on the double bass. DRUM! Magazine commended Taylor's drum work on the song: \"It really shows off Taylor’s versatility. He nails dozens of kicks throughout this fast and tricky song and proves that he could’ve been a big band drummer or ably fit into any theatrical pit band if Queen hadn’t worked out so well for him. Honky-tonk piano, upright bass, ukulele-banjo, and a smokin' drummer all add up to a rollicking good time.\"",

No duffers, and four songs that will just run and run: 'Killer Queen', 'Flick of the Wrist', 'Now I'm Here', and 'In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited'.\" The Winnipeg Free Press commended \"Brian May's multi-tracked guitar, Freddie Mercury's stunning vocalising and Roy Thomas Baker's dynamic production work\", calling the album \"a no-holds barred, full-scale attack on the senses\". Circus referred to the album as \"perhaps the heaviest, rockingest assault on these shores we've enjoyed in some time\". Rolling Stone awarded the album a positive rating of 3 stars and wrote: \"If it's hard to love, it's hard not to admire: this band is skilled, after all, and it dares.\" John Mendelsohn, however, was unimpressed, writing: \"I hunted all over both sides of this latest album for something, anything, even remotely as magnificent as 'Keep Yourself Alive' or 'Father to Son', only to end up empty-eared and bawling.\" As 1974 drew to a close, the album was ranked by Disc as the third best of the year and tied for 24th place on NME's end-of-year list.\nIn a review for the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot awards the album a generally positive rating of 2 and a half stars, while noting that this album was where \"...the songs became more concise\"\n\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic said that \"the theatricality is now wielded on everyday affairs, which ironically makes them sound larger than life. And this sense of scale, combined with the heavy guitars, pop hooks, and theatrical style, marks the true unveiling of Queen, making Sheer Heart Attack as  [sic] the moment where they truly came into their own.\" Q called the record \"indispensable\" and \"one of the great pop/rock admixtures of the '70s\". Pitchfork wrote: \"Sheer Heart Attack not only improves on every aspect of their sound suggested by the first two records, but delivers some of the finest music of their career ... this is the band at the height of its powers.\" Jon Bryan of Backseat Mafia described it as \"the first album where Queen got it unarguably right\", noting that \"such obvious arrogance suited them\".\nBenjamin Ray of the Daily Vault felt that \"Queen somehow manages to sound like every rock band of the 70s on here, including Rush, Zeppelin and even Uriah Heep.\" He noted the difference was that \"Queen actually tries to be pretentious and bombastic, and often they are so over the top one can't help but be entertained\", finally concluding that it was \"their most fun and showcases everything they did right.\" The BBC wrote: \"they stretched contemporary production methods to their very limit with multi-layered vocals and guitars and Freddie's vaudevillian streak finally emerged ... this was the album that finally saw Queen find their true voice.\" Rock historian Paul Fowles wrote that Sheer Heart Attack \"saw the band become increasingly focused on the emerging cult figure of Mercury\" and his \"unique brand of rock theater\", especially on the single \"Killer Queen\".",

        "summary": "The Works is the eleventh studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 20 February 1984 in the US and on 27 February 1984 in the UK by EMI Records just shortly after recording for the album had been completed in the United Kingdom and it is the band's first studio album to be released by Capitol Records in the United States. After the synth-heavy Hot Space (1982), the album saw the re-emergence of Brian May and Roger Taylor's rock sound, while still incorporating the early 80s retro futuristic electronic music (at the behest of Freddie Mercury) and New York funk scenes (John Deacon's topic of interest). Recorded at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California, and Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany, from August 1983 to January 1984, the album's title comes from a comment Taylor made as recording began – \"Let's give them the works!\".\nDuring the decade, after a negative reaction to the music video for \"I Want to Break Free\" in the United States, the band decided not to tour in North America and lost the top spot in US sales, but sales around the world would be much better, especially in Europe. Despite failing to reach number one, it spent 94 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, the longest for a Queen studio album. The Works has sold over six million copies worldwide.",

While a spring tour of South America had been an early possibility, especially in light of the band's success there two years earlier, equipment and promotional problems brought an end to these plans. During this period, Brian May worked with Eddie Van Halen and others on the Star Fleet Project, whilst Roger Taylor and Freddie Mercury began work on their solo albums, Strange Frontier and Mr. Bad Guy respectively. By August 1983, the band reunited and began work on their eleventh studio album. It would be Queen's first album for EMI Records (and its US affiliate Capitol Records) worldwide after the band nullified its recording deal with Elektra for the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan.\nRecording commenced at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles—Queen's only time recording in the United States — and Musicland Studios in Munich. Also during this time, their manager Jim Beach offered them the opportunity to compose the soundtrack for the film The Hotel New Hampshire. The band agreed, but soon discovered much of their time was being spent on the soundtrack instead of the upcoming album, and the soundtrack project fell through. Only one song written for the film—\"Keep Passing the Open Windows\"—made it onto The Works. By November 1983, Roger Taylor's \"Radio Ga Ga\" was chosen as the first single from the album.",

Freddie Mercury reconstructed the track, both musically and lyrically. It was still credited to Taylor since Mercury was an arranger rather than a co-writer. Fred Mandel, their session keyboardist, put together an additive track with piano, synth and a temporary bass part. Brian May used a glass slide for his guitar solo. Taylor sang all the backing vocals, and used a Vocoder throughout the song. Most of the song is made out of electronics and synthesisers.",

The phrase is mentioned on a number of occasions throughout the film and was, according to the opening credits, also co-produced by the band's manager Jim Beach, who changed it in order to suit the album mood better. Mercury played piano and synths and wrote the lyrics after reading the quote in the book.",

Synths are played by Mandel and most of the vocal harmonies were recorded by May himself, particularly in the bridge, except for the lyric \"oh no\" which is Taylor. The song harks back to Queen's old sound, with a song being built around a hard angular and muscular riff. The song features Mercury on lead vocals, doing a call and response with May, who sings the chorus. The song's music video, directed by David Mallet, contains footage of a performance of the song in Brussels. \"Hammer to Fall\" was a concert favourite, and was the third song the band performed at Live Aid in 1985. The song also features in both the setlist of the band's Works Tour and Magic Tour in 1986.",
