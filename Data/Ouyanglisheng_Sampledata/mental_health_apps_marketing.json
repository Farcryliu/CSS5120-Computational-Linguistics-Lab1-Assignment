Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day. Positive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day An affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances. As Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day. There are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine: - They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back. - Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. - They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.

When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. LICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS There are over 30,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials. All of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice. HOW DOES IT WORK? After filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs, preferences, and location. You and your therapist will get your own “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone. You can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist. Together you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? The cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $70 to $100 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on factors like your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

        "description": "The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health. With a gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life. To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love. And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only. Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app: 1. GRATITUDE JOURNAL A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life. In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life. The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling. You can also add photos to your journal entries and can record journals in your voice, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts. 2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS If you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations. Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves. They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves. The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need. You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them. Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them. 3. CREATE VISION BOARDS Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations. In the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards! 4. DAILY ZEN We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude. 5. MINDFUL MINUTES We define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app. Privacy Policy: https://www.notion.so/Gratitude-App-Privacy-Policy-40195d1e9f51499c82dc8f7d06ab2a1c Terms of Use: https://medium.com/@priteshsankhe/terms-and-conditions-c7a676f5d884"

Unlike an emotion tracker or a journaling app, Betwixt takes you on a guided immersive adventure deep into the mysteries of your own mind. On this epic inner journey, you’ll reconnect with your wisest self and unlock a whole range of self-awareness powers: • Improve your emotional intelligence, self care and coping skills • Calm your nerves and soothe overwhelming feelings • Uncover new paths to self improvement, self actualization and growth • Tap into your subconscious through the power of story • Identify your values to increase your motivation, sense of gratitude and life purpose • Deepen your self knowledge to help you in overcoming sadness, resentment, low self esteem, fixed mindset, negative perception, insecurities. ◆ WHAT MAKES BETWIXT WORK Betwixt is a relaxing self-reflection game that draws on decades of psychology research and practice into how we feel, think and behave. It includes tools for emotion regulation and self reflection, journal prompts, elements of CBT, mindfulness approaches, Jungian theory and others. Together, these methods work to help you find courage, clarity, and calm. ◆ AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE In Betwixt, you become the hero (or heroine) of an interactive adventure through a dreamlike world that responds to your thoughts and feelings. We’ve used immersive storytelling and sounds to create an alternative for people who find a CBT diary too dry, and struggle to engage with mindfulness, breathing apps, emotion trackers and journaling. Betwixt stands out by offering a creative, engaging approach that removes distractions, improves your focus, motivation and mindset. ◆ EVIDENCE-BASED Independent psychology research shows that Betwixt can significantly reduce emotion dysregulation, with effects that can last months. For years, we’ve been working with researchers to make the science of self-awareness and resilience accessible to anyone.

Mental health doesn’t wait for the calendar—neither should your mental health care. Download today to book a call with a therapist and see for yourself. Continuous care When you begin the Meru Health program, your licensed Meru Health therapist is available via both scheduled face-to-face video sessions and unlimited, asynchronous chat. It’s support built around your life, not someone else’s schedule. Coaching option The continuous-care model applies to both Meru Health’s 12-week therapy program and our 8-week coaching option (see below), which is supported by certified behavioral health coaches. No one wouldn’t like to feel better. For some, Meru Health coaching is the best way to achieve that. Connecting the mind and the body Mental health isn’t just mental. Nutrition, sleep, exercise, and even simple breath directly impact your mental health. With Meru Health’s wearable heart-rate variability device, you can see this connection in action. The Meru Health App The Meru Health app enhances your care experience with guided, evidence-based lessons and activities that you can do on your own or with support of your therapist or coach. In-network Insurance Coverage Meru Health is covered by several health insurance providers and is a free employee benefit with some employers. Cost depends on individual plans, copays, and deductibles. But even the 12-week program is far cheaper than the average cost of 12 weeks of traditional therapy. Our team will connect with your health plan to determine your cost share, if any. Proven Outcomes After program completion, 73% of Meru participants show clinically significant improvement, and 59% are in remission from symptoms of depression or anxiety.

The app can be used on its own and offers an education programme with over 50 sessions. The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural coaching and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test. Used as a companion tool for the Flow brain stimulation headset, this is a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app. The Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com The programme contains over 50 education sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as: - Exercise Physical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow education explores the types of exercise that are beneficial. - Meditation Meditation is practised by many people around the world as mental “exercise” for the brain. Flow will give you exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life. - Sleep Did you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression. - Nutrition The nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression. Spoiler alert: sugar is one of the big villains."

The Manatee app works best as a companion to our Family Care model! Here’s how that works: 1. Book your consult Have a free 20-minute call with a family expert so we can get to know your family. If it’s a good fit, we’ll schedule your intake session. 2. Assessment and intake After you complete your assessment, you’ll review your results with your therapist, discuss your family’s unique needs and create your 6-week care plan together. 3.

You can use Worrydolls like a journal to help you overcome anxiety and stress. The idea of worrydolls started with the indigenous people of Guatemala. The first worrydoll was given to the princess Ixucane as a special gift from the sun god, with the promise that the worrydoll could handle any worry a person could have. Ever since, tiny worrydolls made leftover cloth have been given to worried people. Whisper a single worry to the worrydoll, and hide it under their pillow. As soon as the worrydoll is told the worry, sorrow, or fear, it takes the burden and carries it from then on. The app works the same way! Just tell a single worry to the Worrydoll, and the Worrydoll will carry it for you. In this way, you can have worrydolls on your phone. When your worry is finished, you can tell the worrydoll that he/she does not need to worry anymore. You can always look back at your old worries to feel a sense of calm. My grandmother gave me tiny worrydolls because I was always worrying as a child. Now, you can have Worrydolls on your phone. I hope that the worrydolls can help you just like they helped me.

Which I guess is the point, but I always try to make it through and never succeed!\" - itsmeyoyeah \"I haven't slept all night without a sleep aid in ages. I've only had (slumber) for two nights, and I haven't slept like these two nights since I was a carefree kid! I have the Calm app, which also has bedtime stories, and that was ok, but still not a full night's sleep and not a lot of variety. Definitely not the control of content like this app provides.\" - fabfourmom SUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS Slumber offers an auto-renewing subscription.

        "description": "Simple, relaxing, endless game. People love it! ∞ Infinity Loop is a fun way of increasing your logic skills. It can be considered a puzzle game about creating intricate looping patterns or just the application of using a simple concept: \"connecting multiple things\" and make fun out of it. Some people say this game is a good puzzle game but with a great zen mode. The goal is to clear your mind, remove the stress from your daily life without any pressure or tension to solve the levels. If you are looking for stress relief or a relaxing game type, enjoy the loop! FAQ How to Play Infinity Loop? Connect all the lines and corners to make perfect connections. It is like killing the chaos and reaching perfection. Watch the video to overview how it works. Check on youtube as well where several people post the solutions. Nonetheless, we suggest you try to find yourself how the game works and what you are supposed to do. How to Play the Infinity Dark Mode? The goal of the dark mode is to make disconnections, breaking it all and not leaving a single piece connected. How many levels the game has? Infinite. How can I save my game progress? Make sure you connect the app with the App Store on the settings panel (the button is at the bottom of the gameplay). This way your progress won't be lost. If you face further issues reach us by email. Do I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop? No. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. Only if you opt for the secondary game, called \"black mode\", you may need to pay a coffee for it after level 100. I don't feel the game is challenging. Why? The challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now. Note: This game is also available on Apple Watches. And it's very fun as well!

Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening. - WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT? Negative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep. - HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK? From the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended escape. An escape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep. Loóna saves your escape sessions to your Apple Health app. The upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of escapes.

        "description": "We are glad to present an application for people suffering from panic attacks and anxiety disorder. The app includes a set of exercises for shifting attention and suppressing anxiety attacks. We know that anxiety is one of the first stages of a panic attack that cannot be controlled. A set of exercises will help to remove the symptoms of anxiety, not allowing it to develop any further. One of the authors of the application once also faced the problem of sudden panic attacks, which for a long time did not let him fully experience his life. Based on our and other people’s experience of suffering from panic attacks, we have added a number of exercises that involve various human senses, preventing you from concentrating on an anxiety attack. Exercises: Breathing exercise. One of the most important parts of suppressing an anxiety attack is the normalization of a person's breathing cycle in order to prevent hyperventilation and dizziness. This is a simple step-by-step exercise for inhaling, holding your breath and exhaling. Visual and vibro signals indicate the duration of each step in the cycle. The application functions provide the ability to customize the exercise for your liking. The app features allow you to choose an exercise preset to align with your mental state, for example, when a panic or anxiety attack occurs, when you are stressed out, or just want to relax. Sound identification exercise. The exercise involves the organs of hearing. The application generates an audio track by mixing several common sounds with different volume levels. The user is to correlate the sounds heard with the images presented. Visual concentration exercise. The exercise involves the organs of vision. The user is to find and take a picture of several items that fit the randomly generated color patterns. AI Therapy This feature is based on artificial intelligence and provides the opportunity for live communication with a virtual psychotherapist. You can ask any questions about the nature of anxiety and panic attacks, get valuable advice or just chat. Journal Daily Journal. In the Daily Journal you can track: Whether you had a panic or anxiety attack on the selected date or not. Severity of the attack Place where the attack occurred A possible reason for the attack occurring Start and end time of the attack A possible reason for the attack ending Your total mood during the day All tracked data will help both you - for a general understanding of your health condition, and your attending therapist - for a more accurate diagnosis and selection of the correct course of treatment. Medical treatment. The app features allow you to add a course of medication prescribed by your therapist, for example, if you started taking antidepressants, tranquilizers, or any other medications. Using this functionality, you can specify: Name of the prescribed medication Treatment duration The frequency of taking the medication in days, for example, if you need to take it not every day, but every other day The frequency of taking the medication per day Dosage of medication, relative to intake count per day Additionally, in the Daily Journal, you can note whether the medicine was taken, which will allow you to discipline your medication treatment and remember to take the medicine on time. The overall picture will let you and your therapist know whether the chosen course of treatment has a positive or negative effect. The application is therapeutic in nature and will help to relieve the symptoms, but it will not be able to get rid of the source of the problem. The source of the problem is individual and hidden deeper within, so we strongly recommend contacting the appropriate specialist to solve the source of the problem. We would be really grateful if you could share your ideas and suggestions, as well as rate the app so that more people will know about us. Take care of yourself and your loved ones."

We'll analyze and interpret the data to determine your current stress levels. We constantly monitor your status and remind your immediately if your stress levels get too high so you can take action right away to help reduce your stress levels. #How can StressWatch help you? - When you work late into the night, StressWatch can remind you that your HRV is low and you're stressed - a gentle reminder to help you understand that it's time to get some rest. - When you're at a social event and you have to force yourself to smile, we'll remind you that your HRV is low and you're stressed - a gentle reminder to get some fresh air and recharge. - When you've had just a bit too much to drink, we'll remind you that your HRV is low and you're stressed (because alcohol is a stresssor) - a gentle reminder to let up a bit on the cup, drink some water, and take care of your body. - You can constantly monitor your HRV levels (and stress levels) from your Apple Watch by adding StressWatch to your Watch Face. - Paired with proper exercise and adequate rest, monitor and analyze your weekly and monthly stress levels over prolonged periods of time; you'll realize that you're getting better as time goes on. #Design Concept We created StressWatch with the sole intention to help people to reduce anxiety in this age of stress and pressure. However, data and numbers do not have any meaning if the user is unable to interpret the data. (Not everyone is a rocket scientist!) So it got us thinking: how can we design a app that delivers numbers and data in a friendly manner that will help users to reduce stress and anxiety. Thus, we created the \"Mr.Fizz\", which is the foundation of our product design. The \"Mr.Fizz\" will change colors as the user's stress levels rise. #Contact us Email: hi@stresswatch.app Subscription prices and terms StressWatch can be downloaded for free. If you choose to upgrade to the StressWatch Pro version, you can unlock all paid features. We offer two different purchase options: monthly, and annual auto-renewal.

        "description": "“We believe that mindfulness is more than a form of stress relief — it can be a tool for personal growth, deeper understanding, vibrancy. More than a way to disconnect — it can be a way to feel a part of something bigger. More than simply silence — it can be immersive, beautiful, moving.” –Raed Khawaja, Open Co-founder & CEO Regulate your nervous system with Open. Bridge science and spirituality to cleanse your body and mind. Learn breathwork, meditation, and movement techniques designed by experts in neurobiology. Practice on the app and in-person at our flagship studio in Los Angeles. CLASSES BREATHE: Since the dawn of civilization, humans have developed techniques for manipulating our breath to induce desired states of consciousness. Now peer-reviewed studies in neuroscience and psychology confirm that breathwork is a powerful toolkit for regulating your nervous system, optimizing your health and well-being, and catalyzing personal transformation. Breathwork is an umbrella term for myriad practices, both ancient and modern. While many techniques are deeply rooted in spiritual traditions like Yoga, Qi Gong, and Buddhism, contemporary applications integrate ancient wisdom with modern science.This synthesis of ancient and modern has given rise to transformational breathwork, designed to induce profound experiences of catharsis, insight, and breakthrough. Experience a mental reset with just a few minutes of conscious breathing. MEDITATE: Train your awareness and contemplate wisdom – with techniques that span generations, cultures, and traditions – with our daily meditations and monthly programs. Learn how to enhance your focus, reduce your stress and anxiety, and regulate your emotions with simple mindfulness techniques you can incorporate into your daily life. MOVE: Our methodology is designed through the intelligence of fitness – blending endurance, strength, mobility, and recovery – with the wisdom of mindfulness. A ritual for resilience, strengthening the body and mind. ANYTIME, ANYWHERE: Practice on your time with our endless library, with fresh classes added daily. From simple 5-minute breathwork techniques, to 60-minute strength and conditioning classes, build your practice to fit your schedule and meet your goals. Whether you’re starting your journey or seeking a new challenge, there are classes for every level and mood. PROGRESS TRACKING: Create a daily habit that sticks with progress tracking, push reminders, streaks, and badges. A consistent breathwork and meditation practice has proven to reduce cortisol levels and regulate the nervous system–decreasing stress, supporting emotional well-being, and enhancing mental clarity. These techniques can also improve physical health by increasing heart rate variability, promoting cardiovascular health, and boosting immune function. CONNECT WITH US Questions?

        "description": "In 1 minute, find the cause of mood swings, intense emotional changes, low energy, and more. HOW DOES IT WORK? Look at the color ring & pick the color you are drawn to first. There are 7 colors left. Now choose the most pleasant of the remaining ones. Continue until you run out of colors. ACCURACY To get the most accurate result please select colors based on your preferences at this specific moment. Do not think too much, let your subconscious do the job. Do NOT associate colors with objects, — cars, clothes, buildings, etc. Just pick colors you like right at this moment. WHY DOES THIS WORK? Colors have surrounded mankind since the beginning of time and have influenced us for generations. In the beginning, human life was ruled by two uncontrollable factors: night and day. Light and darkness. For thousands of years man's actions, such as attack (red) or retreat (green) were embedded into our brains. The colors of nature have had their influence on us, and these influences are deep-rooted in our psyche. Colors and their subconscious meaning are there, whether we like it or not. That meaning is independent of race, language, education level, social status, etc. This app is the ultimate tool for understanding the inner self, mood fluctuation, productivity level, and more. FEATURES: • Anxiety, productivity & energy analysis • Harmony, Independence & openness levels • Daily check-in for mood, empathy, self union & more • Detailed mood description • Works on iPhone, iPad and Watch • Monthly summaries and charts • Auto syncs to all your devices • No registration, accounts or passwords • Zero ads SAFE AND SECURE: Privacy is not something you are merely entitled to, it is an absolute prerequisite.

Toto teaches you to face anxiety head-on using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) - one of the most effective, evidence-based approaches for anxiety and OCD recovery. Unlike other apps that teach relaxation or distraction, Toto helps you build real resilience by changing your relationship with anxiety itself. WHAT MAKES TOTO DIFFERENT Most anxiety apps teach you to calm down or avoid triggers. Toto does the opposite - it teaches you that the way OUT of anxiety is THROUGH it. Based on \"Nothing Works\" anxiety therapy principles, you'll learn that trying to control anxiety only makes it stronger. START FREE WITH 7 ESSENTIAL DAYS Get immediate access to the core program that covers the fundamentals: - Daily lessons on ACT principles and exposure therapy - Real-world examples showing how others face their fears - Gradual exposure exercises tailored to your triggers - Audio guidance for challenging moments - Evidence-based techniques used by therapists worldwide In just 7 days, you'll understand the principles that can transform your relationship with anxiety.

THE SCIENCE BEHIND TOTO Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is backed by decades of research. Instead of fighting anxiety, ACT teaches psychological flexibility - the ability to be present with discomfort while taking action toward what matters. Studies show that exposure therapy and acceptance-based approaches are more effective than avoidance strategies for long-term anxiety relief. START YOUR RECOVERY JOURNEY Breaking free from anxiety doesn't mean eliminating fear - it means no longer letting fear control you. With Toto, you'll learn to: - Stop avoiding situations that trigger anxiety - Welcome uncomfortable thoughts and feelings - Take action even when you feel afraid - Build confidence through repeated exposure - Live according to your values, not your fears Download Toto today and start your free 7-day program.

The worst thing about anxiety is it's very difficult to think yourself out of it. Anxious feelings create anxious thoughts, which create anxious feelings and so on. It's a vicious circle with you at its center. But there is some good news. The free hypnosis session in the app - Overcome Fear & Anxiety - will relax you so wonderfully deeply that for a good while afterwards your anxiety levels will be much, much lower, if you have any anxiety at all. Then, repeated listening will calm your nervous system so profoundly that it will start to get much harder to get anxious, and when you start to feel that way a lot of the time, the anxiety problem will be well on its way to being sorted for good. With over 20 years experience, and more than 1/2 million hypnosis sessions sold, Uncommon Knowledge knows how to set your mind at rest. The app is super-simple, you just install it and hit play on the free session. You can use that for as long as you like, but if you want more variety at any time you can upgrade to the monthly paid option and access 10 more anxiety sessions. Our most popular anxiety session 'Overcome Fear & Anxiety' is free inside the app to reduce your anxiety right away. Then, if you like what you hear, you can unlock the other anxiety sessions with the monthly payment option. From Uncommon Knowledge, delivering hypnosis since 1998. # CONTENTS # # Free: • Overcome Fear & Anxiety # Paid: • Generalized Anxiety Treatment • Anticipatory Anxiety • Overcome Performance Anxiety • Shyness and Social Anxiety • Stop Panic Attacks • 7:11 Breathing Relaxation • Stop Thinking the Worst • Trust Yourself • Body Scan Relaxation • Spring Meadow Relaxation # Monthly: $4.99/month Overcome Anxiety Hypnosis Downloads offers an auto-renewing subscription option.

Whether you're working through anxiety, stress, burnout, relationships, or life’s ups and downs, Grow helps you find the right provider, book quickly, and stay supported before, during, and after your sessions. With over 1 million clients served and 3 million+ sessions delivered, Grow has built trust the old-fashioned way – one session at a time. Now with the Grow Therapy app, your care can move with you. Because life doesn’t pause between sessions, and now, neither does your care. The support you need. The way you need it. * Therapy that fits your schedule: Evenings, weekends, no waitlists * Thousands of therapists who get you: Search by identity, specialty, language, and more * Covered by insurance: 100+ plans accepted—some sessions cost as little as $0 * Clear cost estimates: No subscriptions. No hidden fees * All-in-one care: Therapy and medication support in one place Say hello to coach At the heart of the Grow app is coach, a conversational AI tool built specifically to support your mental health between sessions. With more than one-third* of Americans already comfortable using AI for mental health support, we wanted to build an alternative that keeps a clinician’s expertise and training front and center. Most AI tools aren’t designed for therapy and they don’t integrate with your provider. We built coach to be different. Grow’s coach is an AI-powered, guided support tool built with clinical input, privacy, and safety at its core. It’s designed to help you reflect, build on your sessions, and keep growing between visits. Grow’s coach is fine-tuned to complement your care, not replace it, working in alignment with your provider and care plan, never independently. Do the work with your therapist. Practice it between sessions with coach. The Grow App: Stay connected and supported—anytime, anywhere. Book and join sessions, message your provider, and grow between visits with guided support, reflection, and practice from coach. Here’s what you can do in the app: * Book and join sessions in one tap * Message your provider anytime, securely * Use pre-session check-ins and post-session tools to stay on track * Get guided support between sessions with coach * Access handouts, worksheets, and therapy tools * Track your progress with session insights and reminders * Manage therapy and medication in one place The Grow app brings therapy into real life. Whether you’re prepping for a session, navigating a tough moment, or reflecting on progress, your care stays with you, wherever you are. Feeling better starts easier at Grow. Download Grow Therapy and take the first step. Note: coach is available to eligible clients in select U.S. states. Grow’s coach is AI-powered and designed to support you between sessions. It doesn't replace therapy, isn't monitored in real time, and isn't a crisis tool. Grow’s coach is not a replacement for any medical diagnosis or treatments; likewise, it cannot, and does not intend to, provide medical advice or diagnosis. If you’re in a crisis or emergency, call 988 or 911. CONNECT WITH US! We’re always happy to hear from you!

Support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make big, positive changes. We created Regain so anyone can have convenient, discreet, and affordable access to professional help. Common relationship problems people seek help for are difficulty communicating, high levels of conflict, disagreement over finances, children, or in-laws, and problems with infidelity, to name just a few. LICENSED AND TRAINED THERAPISTS All therapists on Regain have at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced and accredited psychologists (PhD/PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials. All of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training and practice. HOW DOES IT WORK? After filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. Your partner will be invited to this room as well if you decide to try therapy together. You can also schedule a session so speak live with your therapist over video or phone. You can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights and guidance. This ongoing dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist. If you choose to try therapy on ReGain with your partner (either at the start of therapy, or if you choose to invite them later), your dialogue would be between all three of you: you, your partner, and your therapist. Together you will work towards making a positive change in your relationship and accomplishing your goals. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? The cost of therapy through Regain ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your Regain membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the counseling service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

Your answers will become the basis for the formation of individual recommendations. We pay attention to every wish when selecting highly qualified specialists for each Mindly client. ALL THERAPISTS HAVE A DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND VIDEO PROFILES Before signing up for a session, you have the opportunity to view the specialist's video presentation, his certifications and learn about the specifics of his or her therapy. In addition, you can contact a specialist via chat to clarify any questions that may arise during the selection process. CHOOSE ANY TIME THAT WORKS FOR YOU At Mindly, we understand that waiting weeks or months for a therapy session is no longer relevant. In today's on-demand world, mental health should not be an exception. That's why with Mindly you have the opportunity to book a therapy session and get a consultation from a psychologist today, no more waiting! RESCHEDULE AND CANCEL SESSIONS AS NEEDED You are free to cancel or reschedule your session as many times as you need, but this must be done at least 24 hours before the scheduled time. If some unforeseen circumstances arose and you were unable to do so within the specified period, you always have the opportunity to discuss rescheduling the session directly with your psychologist. HOLD SESSIONS ONLINE FROM ANY DEVICE We have our own video calling system integrated into the Mindly platform, so you can join a session through our mobile app or through a browser on your computer. All video calls are guaranteed to be secure and confidential. CHAT WITH YOUR THERAPIST AT YOUR CONVENIENCE Mindly has an integrated chat that allows you to ask any of our experts questions and get answers quickly.

HelloMind helps you take back control from negative emotions, cravings, fears and bad habits and it can improve your motivation and enjoyment of life. Try the Sleep Boosters: - Have a good night’s sleep - Sleep more peacefully Or boost your confidence with the sessions: - Have more confidence - Improve your self-worth - Become self-confident Or kick that anxiety for good with sessions like: - Be more calm - Get rid of your fear of panicking - My ability to de-stress Or get rid of your phobia eg.: - Spiders - Dentists - Enclosed spaces MORE Low self-esteem, stress, fear, bad sleep and unhealthy habits sometimes hold us back in life and prevent us from enjoying things to the fullest. The good news is these negative patterns can be broken or eliminated. We created the HelloMind app to help you make a change. We want you to be able to think better and feel stronger. Anywhere, any time without having to spend a lot of time and money on treatment. The key to happiness lies within you. And HelloMind works because you are making the change yourself. Choose a treatment with 10 sessions if you want help to remove or change something like a craving, a habit or a fear. Each session takes about 30 minutes, and your series of 10 sessions should be completed within about 30 days. Choose a Booster if you’d like to reinforce good emotions boost motivation or strengthen a certain area of yourself. HelloMind uses a method called RDH - Result Driven Hypnosis, a form of guided hypnosis. RDH is especially effective because it helps you go to the root cause of your problem. The theory behind it says that when you’re consciously able to define the problem, your subconscious can find the solution. That’s why you’re gently guided into your subconscious towards the root of your problem then given the tool to fix it. The ten sessions in a treatment or the sessions in a Booster are variations on the same theme, so you’ll hear something different every time you listen. But listening to all 10 sessions in treatment is the only way to ensure that you go deep enough into your subconscious to discover the root of the problem. Every time you listen, you’ll feel a little more safe, because the process is underway and you’ve become accustomed to it. That’s why you relax more as the hypnosis stages become more profound. When choosing a hypnotherapy treatment, you should always begin with your main problem. The app will guide you to the right treatment or Booster with simple questions. Choosing the right treatment is actually an important part of the process. When you can consciously define the problem, your subconscious will know the solution. HelloMind integrates with the Apple Health app counting mindfullness minutes.

        "description": "This application uses many advanced digital technics and simulates EMDR therapy. EMDR is a technique recommended by psychotherapists and Psychologists. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an extensively researched psychotherapy method proven to be effective and help people recover from trauma and other distressing life experiences which are including depression, PTSD, panic disorders, anxiety. The American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs/Dept. of Defense, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the World Health Organization among many other national and international organizations recognize and recommend EMDR therapy as an effective treatment. First, put on your headphones, think of a traumatic and disturbing event. Follow the ball in the EMDR tool, focus on the transition of sounds in your left and right ears, and feel the vibrations. Thus, the effect of traumatic disturbing events that will provide the data flow between the right and left brain as in REM sleep will decrease. Focus on the trauma memory while simultaneously experiencing bilateral stimulation (typically eye movements), which is associated with a reduction in the vividness and emotion associated with the trauma memories. While you bring the details of that memory to mind, This tool will guide you through a series of side-to-side eye movements, auditory (with direction), and vibrations. As you learn to process the memory and related feelings it brings up, you’ll gradually be able to reframe that memory in a more positive light. Use three types of BLS: visual, auditory (with direction), and vibrations and modify your settings to suit your preferences. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy developed by Francine Shapiro in the 1980s that was originally designed to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In EMDR, the person being treated recalls distressing experiences whilst doing bilateral stimulation, such as side-to-side eye movement or physical stimulation, such as tapping either side of the body. According to the theory behind the approach, traumatic and painful memories can cause post-traumatic stress when you don’t process them completely. Then, when sights, sounds, words, or smells trigger those unprocessed memories, you re-experience them. The 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) practice guideline states that EMDR \"is based on the idea that negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are the result of unprocessed memories. The treatment involves standardized procedures that include focusing simultaneously on spontaneous associations of traumatic images, thoughts, emotions and bodily sensations and bilateral stimulation that is most commonly in the form of repeated eye movements. This re-experiencing leads to the emotional distress and other symptoms recognized as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). EMDR aims to reduce symptoms of trauma by changing how your memories are stored in your brain. In a nutshell, an EMDR therapist does this by leading you through a series of bilateral (side-to-side) eye movements as you recall traumatic or triggering experiences in small segments, until those memories no longer cause distress."

If you wish, you can also set a mindfulness chime at any interval to gently bring you back to meditation if your thoughts do wander. Pleasant nature sounds as switchable background sounds help you meditate when your mind (or your environment) is particularly restless. Our guided meditations by professional speakers provide you with additional guidance and motivation for your daily meditation practice. The ‘teaching’ provides a brief and undogmatic overview of the most important aspects of meditation practice and offers you inspiration and motivation for your regular meditation. Conclusion: This app is perfect for you if you want to bring more mindfulness into your life with meditation. It doesn't matter whether you've never meditated before or are an old hand at meditation. By the way: since version 4.0, we have even built in special modes for the masters of meditation: the Master Mode for up to 4 hours of meditation at a time and the Zen Mode, which sounds the end chime three times. With this in mind, I wish you: a peaceful mind and a calm disposition. Why use a meditation app at all? A meditation app offers a simple and accessible way to regularly integrate mindfulness and inner peace into your everyday life. It helps to reduce stress, promote concentration and increase general well-being. Especially in a hectic world where we are often overwhelmed by obligations and distractions, a meditation app helps to create moments of calm and to arrive in the here and now. There is an important connection between meditation apps and the concept of MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), a scientifically based method for reducing stress. MBSR uses mindfulness exercises such as meditation, breathing techniques and body scans to manage stress and chronic strain. Many meditation apps are based on similar principles and offer guided exercises that integrate the central elements of MBSR. This allows users to benefit from the proven techniques and integrate mindfulness into their everyday lives - whether to manage stress, improve sleep or promote serenity.

This is meditation you can feel, guided by dynamic vibrations, audio and lighting. Connect your Core Meditation Trainer with the app, drop in, and go. Together with the Trainer, the Core app will track your personal progress using stress-level measurements and other biometric data insights. DIVE INTO OUR MEDITATION LIBRARY - Learn new Breath Training techniques, then practice them on your own with Core's guiding vibrations. - Unwind with longer guided classes, or jump into a short 3-minute session — whatever fits your schedule. - Meditations guided by our expert instructors cover a variety of topics, geared towards all experience levels. - Pick a vibration pattern, choose a duration, and drop into one of Core's original ambient and musical soundscapes. Your Core Meditation Trainer pulses alongside your sessions. Depending on the type of meditation, the vibrations will guide you in learning Breath Training techniques, or serve as a gentle reminder to help focus your attention and anchor you in the present. MEASURE YOUR PROGRESS No more wondering whether meditation is actually working for you or not. With the Core Meditation Trainer connected to your app, you can see how meditation is directly affecting your body through several different metrics: - Training - Track your consistency over time. Making meditation a part of your regular routine helps train your brain to respond to it, and unlocks numerous health benefits. - Calm - Calm is represented by the dominance of your parasympathetic nervous system. We measure this based on your heart rate and its variability over time (HRV). With practice, you can train yourself to reach a Calm state more quickly. - Focus - Some techniques get you energized, priming your mind and activating your senses into a highly responsive state. Core measures how much time you spend in a Focused state by the pattern of your heart rhythm. After each meditation, Core will show you how Calm and Focused you were. Long-term historical graphs lets you see how your resilience to stress is changing over time, and track your progress with daily streaks. Core will also integrate with Apple HealthKit to share Mindful Minutes and read data to improve the accuracy of your biometric insights.

        "description": "Vipassana Research Institute (VRI), a non-profit-making body, was established in 1985 with the principal aim of conducting scientific research into the sources and applications of the Vipassana Meditation Technique. It is a technique of observation and exploration of the mind-body phenomena. The technique leads to purification of mind and can bring about a major transformation in the attitude and behavioural pattern of an individual and, through him, in the entire society. It has a unique potential as an instrument for better education, health, organisation, management development and social change for strengthening the concept of secularism, national integration and international understanding. From time to time, we all experience agitation, frustration and disharmony. When we suffer, we do not keep our misery limited to ourselves; instead, we keep distributing it to others. Certainly this is not a proper way to live. We all want to live peacefully within ourselves, and with those around us. After all, human beings are social beings: we have to live and interact with others. How, then, can we live peacefully? How, then, can we remain harmonious ourselves, and maintain peace and harmony around us? Vipassana enables us to experience peace and harmony by purifying the mind, freeing it from suffering and the deep-seated causes of suffering. Step by step, the practice leads to the highest spiritual goal of full liberation from all mental defilements. Vipassana has been revived after a period of more than 2500 years. Courses of Vipassana meditation started in India since 1969, however, initially, there was no separate institution to explore the theory part of the technique. The importance of establishing such an Institute was realized when Mr. S. N. Goenka, principal teacher of Vipassana meditation, began teaching courses on the Satipatthāna Sutta, a discourse in which the Buddha systematically explains the technique of Vipassana. During the Satipatthāna courses, Goenkaji noticed students studying the words of the Buddha (pariyatti), were encouraged and filled with gratitude when applying them in their meditation practice (patipatti). They found their understanding and practice strengthened, owing to their experiential understanding of the Buddha’s words. Naturally, some of them felt inspired to undertake further study, and to provide this opportunity, the Vipassana Research Institute was established. For decades now, the words of Goenkaji have inspired masses to not only get introduced to the technique but also to go deeper in their meditative practice. This app aims to make Vipassana Meditation instructions and media available globally to all so that all benefit from this wonderful technique."

        "description": "Declutter The Mind offers guided meditation for mindfulness, sleep, anxiety, stress, work, and a lot more. In addition, Declutter The Mind offers 30-day courses that will teach you how to meditate, form the habit of a regular practice, and expand your mind through the teachings of mindfulness meditation. This is all without positioning meditation as something mystical, spiritual, or supernatural for it to work for you. The science already shows that a regular meditation practice improves mental health and happiness. Let our app help you unlock these benefits without attaching it to something woo-woo. Declutter The Mind offers a practical and easy approach to sitting down and observing the mind. With enough practice, you’ll start to have insights into your mind, how it works, and how busy it is. These insights can make you a calmer, less reactive, and happier person. WHAT IS MEDITATION If you want to understand the mind, sit down and observe it. Meditation is using a non-judgemental awareness to notice what thoughts, feelings, and sensations appear in consciousness. It’s about becoming aware of just how busy the mind is, and breaking away from that momentum. Buddhists call this the monkey mind, the mind that’s constantly busy and chattering, sometimes without us even fully noticing it. We can call this clutter, and this app will help you declutter the mind. HOW IT WORKS Meditation doesn’t require any special equipment, or crossing your legs in a particular way, or holding your fingers out. You just need a comfortable and quiet spot where you can remain undisturbed for 10 minutes. Once you’ve found your spot, choose the guided meditation that best suits your needs. If you’re unsure where to start, check out the Essentials category to find meditations for beginners. Choose the session, select your length, and follow the guided instructions. WHAT’S IN THE APP - Several categories of individual guided meditations - Courses for new practitioners and experienced meditators - A new guided meditation every single day with the Daily Guided Meditation feature - 30-day mindfulness course for beginners - 10-day loving-kindness course - Theory included in each lesson, along with a guided practice - Emergency category allowing you quick sessions in times of need - Heart your favorites so they’re easy to find and return to later - Set a daily reminder to meditate at the time you want with the built-in Push Notification Reminders - Meditation timer for unguided meditation - Dark mode and light mode - Download play offline - Different types of meditation: Mindfulness, Vipassana, Loving-Kindness, visualization, body scan - Meditation and mindfulness articles to deepen your leaning - Guided meditation led by a 15+ year practitioner TOPICS INCLUDE - Mindfulness - Body scan - Loving-kindness - Breathing exercises - Anxiety - Stress - PTSD - Depression - Sleep - Relaxation - Focus - Concentration and clarity - Morning and waking up - Energy - Cravings - Anger - Mental health - Managing emotions UPCOMING FEATURES - Live guided meditations - Track your minutes and time meditating using Mindful Minutes and Apple Health - Track stats: total minutes meditated, number of days total meditated - Selectable meditation length - Group meditation sessions with friends and family - Friends list - Apple Watch integration All guided meditations are free for life.

A key reason many new meditators fall off is because they do not receive feedback in their learning process, or guidance on what is working for them and why. This can lead to confusion, agitation and often, a clean break from their practice. Equa's interactive experience provides the feedback you need to make your training experience relevant and impactful. Because meditation is not meant to be practiced alone.

        "description": "Less stressed. More resilient. Healthier. Flowtime app has scientifically validated lessons made by renowned guides on various topics. The free timer mode makes the app compatible with other apps. That helps you record data with just one app while you listen to audio from other apps. Fill your goal rings with whatever audio you listen to. While practice is made easy, it's simple to make meditation your new habit. # SCIENTIFICALLY VALID LESSONS Meditation helps us relax while guided lesson matters. Flowtime lessons were validated scientifically to improve stress resilience in a randomized controlled trial completed in collaboration with Mobio Interactive and the University of Toronto. There are about 120 sessions from professional meditation instructions, including courses engaging in relationships, performance, stress, leadership, focus, anxiety, mindful pregnancy, and so on. # IMMERSIVE GUIDED BREATHING TRAINING Experience mindful immersion with our innovative audio, visual, and vibration guidance. Make it easy even for beginners to cultivate calm awareness in the present moment and prevent the mind from wandering. # GOAL TRACKER RINGS Tracking your goals daily makes meditation feel more real and less like an abstract, unattainable concept. It's a small step that can really make a difference in achieving your goals. Every minute you practice counts automatically towards closing the ring. # FREE TIMER MODE When you are still finding the audio that suits you from different apps and platforms, it's essential to record all the practice in one app. Start timer mode, you are free to listen to any lessons from Insight Timer, Calm, Headspace, or even YouTube. Every minute you practice counts in the goal trackers. # BIOFEEDBACK MEDITATION Know you're getting there as you hear the sound that verifies your desired state, whether it's flow, breath coherence, alpha or theta status, or focused concentration. No more guesswork or relying solely on feelings. There are 11 metrics available to set up. # VISUALIZED RICH BIODATA REPORT The real-time data matters when you are doing meditation, while rich biodata reports after practice are also crucial to measuring your practice every time and insights into your progress. The sensors passively sense your brain and heart activities, and the app translates them into visualized graphs of your body performance. You will be eager to see how well you perform after you practice. # MONTHLY & YEARLY REPORT Trends help us see the big picture when small changes add up. They make it easier to spot important changes. Some metrics like HRV can be less responsive, so it's better to look at them on a monthly or yearly basis. **You can use the Flowtime app alone or with the Flowtime headband, which is available to purchase in the app.** With your permission, Flowtime can write Mindful Minutes on the Apple Health app for health tracking. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. You can send feedback on the app or email us.
