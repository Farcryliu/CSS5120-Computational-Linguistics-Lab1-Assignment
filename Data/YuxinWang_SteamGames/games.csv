Most states did not survive the third world war. The borders between them were erased, and a unified form of government was established on the planet - corporatocracy, which put power over people in the hands of cold-blooded boards of directors of transnational companies.

"1025440,Fantasy General II,Sep 5, 2019,100000 - 200000,13,0,13.99,0,4,Three hundred years have passed since the Shadow Wars have ravaged Keldonia and the world of Aer, and the struggles of the past have long since faded into legends. In the Highlands of Fareach, Clans of Barbarian warriors have eked out a living in the harsh northern climate, constantly feuding with each other and raiding the wealthier Borderland towns. Fed up with these constant attacks, the Borderland Clans called on the Empire for help – a powerful realm controlling the land from the Scarlett Mountains to Cynehelm Valley and the Hoarwood. The Western Imperial Legion was sent to face the highland raiders, and with the help of the Borderland clans Iseal and Machnar, killed High King Brendan in the battle of Wyrm’s Pass. A treaty was signed that forbade any clan from crossing into the Borderlands in return for peace. Since then, there has been no High King to unite the Clans, and they fell into quarrelling and raiding amongst themselves. In these dark times your clan has been led by Falir One-Eye, a warrior of great renown. You are his son and designated heir, and you are eager to prove your mettle to the Clan Council and your father… The Legacy Fantasy General II: Invasion is the reimagination of the strategy game classic from the 90s! Armies once again draw battle-lines on the war-torn land of Keldonia, and a new generation of commanders will test their bravery and tactics against each other. Fantasy wargaming is back! The Battles True to the tradition of the original game, Fantasy General II is all about turn-based battles. Lead over 75 different unique unit types, including powerful heroes. Take into consideration terrain, weapons and armour, magical effects, morale, and the balance of forces, make a plan, execute it, and vanquish your enemy, forging your reputation as a savage war-leader. The Campaign Battle after battle, you will need to make decisions and develop your army. The young clan members will need to be trained, and as they gain enough experience, even the greenest recruits can be turned into champions. But beware: costly victories can be worse than a defeat… when battle-hardened units perish, so does their progression and experience. Each unit comes with their specific abilities, arms and armour, and they can be equipped with magic artefacts you find during battle and upgraded with gold and resources that you need to plunder from your enemy. The Clans A confederation of autonomous hill-land tribes, who value their independence and will fight fiercely for it. Field axemen, berserkers, spearmaidens, trolls and shamans, summon ancestor spirits and mighty elementals or train nimble stag riders and deadly werebears or recruit mercenaries from longbowmen to centaurs. The Empire The most powerful realm on the face of Aer. Face the mighty Legions of the Empire and their magical creations from dragon cannons to golems as well as the Undead hordes they bring to battle, or fight harpies, lizard people and great dragons on your way. The World The world of Aer is filled with beauty and wonders. From the cold, magic-rich highlands of Fareach, home to the player’s Barbarian Clans, to the Borderlands with their fertile river valleys and deep woods where witches and monsters still roam free; from the Sunken Land, submerged through a great Cataclysm and filled with treacherous swamp and Lizardfolk, to the refined and temperate Empire to the South, home to wondrous cities and built upon undead labour. Your campaign will see you fight across very different battlefields, requiring variable tactics and army composition.,['English', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Simplified Chinese', 'French', 'Russian'],[],“And this is the very reason why I believe Fantasy General 2: Invasion has not only tremendous staying power, but the potential of a fulfilling future.” 9 – Turn Based Lovers “Graphically, I found the game beautiful, the music even great (the main track has been remastered from the original). The dialogue text and story depth is completely sufficient for me. Even though the balance of the game is not perfect and the level of difficulty is so high that it just cannot be done without reloading and optimizing, I still recommend any lover of turn-based games to buy it. Otherwise, you'll miss one of the most challenging and gripping genre representatives of the year!” 9.0 – Gamersglobal “Like its predecessor, Fantasy General 2 captivates from the first mission and even improves a lot of things from the original: The moral system is more transparent, the missions with their very different goals and many side locations are much more dynamic. I am moved to try everything to prevent my heroes and experienced units from perishingr. Again and again I am faced with risky decisions: Should I follow the fleeing enemy with my decimated troops? Or rather rest at the risk that the refugees will reform themselves? This is how to make a worthy, contemporary successor to a decades-old classic!” 86 – Gamestar,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/header.jpg?t=1745952562,http://www.slitherine.com/,http://www.slitherine.com/,support@slitherine.co.uk,True,False,False,80,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fantasy-general-ii?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1025,210,,77,994,,489,0,52,0,Owned by Gravity,Slitherine Ltd.,Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor,Family Sharing,Strategy,Strategy,Turn-Based Strategy,Fantasy,Turn-Based,Turn-Based Tactics,Turn-Based Combat,Tactical,Singleplayer,Wargame,Hex Grid,Grand Strategy,Dark Fantasy,4X,Multiplayer,War,Military,Replay Value,Resource Management,Great Soundtrack,Management,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_57b6e3dd42bf8aac70d314a730025c61bb011145.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_a46e457c1b6b011e6082749d31f359fd0e73908a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_6a2457f8558f11a85d99d329f331e7036700dcba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_804d20248bea3fb1d8b01fda877ae911153e5280.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_e77995e8140dd298e794123698a0f1fc600b7a3b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_c6f1ba65d5b6e35a17b29f0735d3a01f4ac9738d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_4fbaae12bf8177d067cc0f0841856dd63672d22c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_0089fed477f0cee44e80853c16d35e2077744ca1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025440/ss_40b7b0473713dcf7187c3e72ceac6dca0333de80.1920x1080.jpg?t=1745952562,"

"1607040,Evertried,Oct 21, 2021,0 - 20000,0,0,5.99,0,1,'Every Move Matters' In Evertried, the player’s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don’t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny. STORY In a world of unflinching order, The Tower is the beacon for lost souls that cannot be assigned to either eternal penitence or the afterlife. Its purpose is to provide lost souls the opportunity to prove their fate by climbing to the very top as a way of peregrinating. Without a clear memory of what happened, you know one thing: You did not prove your worth while alive. Through your first steps in The Tower, you are faced with a mindless beast, a wolf-like creature that looks aggressive and confused. As it rushes to attack you, you find an eerie Scythe and slay the beast where it stood. You feel a strange connection to your memories getting back. The weight of the weapon. The cold decision on how to wield it. There is no doubt: You were a warrior in your past life.

Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever; lose everything, and it’s game over! You command the broad strokes of your defenses and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand. Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion. A stronger, smarter defense leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors. Your home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival. Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red. It’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans. Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North .,['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean', 'Turkish'],[],“Bad North strips away just the right amount of complexity and headache that real-time strategy games tend to have, resulting in a core experience that is challenging, rewarding, and very replayable.” 4/5 – StrategyGamer “Do not be fooled by the cute sound effects or adorable sprites: Bad North is not a lovely new friend.

"2075820,Controller Sync,Nov 18, 2023,20000 - 50000,0,0,0.99,0,0,Description Controller Sync is an arcade-style reaction game that lets you practice and compare your controller-skills with all other players. In order to play, you have to have an X-Box - or Playstation - like controller installed on your device. Gamemodes There are two main gamemodes in Controller Sync: Solo and Duo The Solo gamemode lets you focus on reaction speed and correct key usage , while you have to focus on good communication and synchronization in the Duo gamemode. You can play together with anyone! Leaderboard You can see the highscores of all players on the ingame-leaderboard. How does the game work? When starting a new game, you got 60 seconds to collect as many points as you can. Points can be gained by controlling a cursor with your joystick and pressing the right button for the nearest dot. Dots can either have the color blue or red . To collect a blue dot, you have to select blue as your controller color (The opposite with red dots). The collected dots are then stored in a blue or a red bar depending on the dot color.

"3740060,Hapless,May 29, 2025,0 - 20000,0,0,0.49,0,0,This is a turret defense game. This is an exciting tower defense game where players are placed in an open green field with a winding path composed of white squares. Enemies will attack along this path. At the beginning of the game, players have a certain amount of funds and need to plan reasonably, making choices from defense towers with different prices and placing them in suitable grid positions. In the game, enemies come in a variety of shapes, including small and agile ground monsters, as well as aerial enemies with flying abilities. They surge in waves, attacking the player's defense system. Each defense tower has its own characteristics. Basic defense towers can carry out routine attacks, while advanced defense towers have stronger firepower, longer range, or special attack effects. As the game progresses, players obtain funds by eliminating enemies, which can be used to upgrade defense towers or deploy new towers to cope with increasingly powerful enemy attacks. The game tests players' strategic planning ability. How to build efficient defense layouts with limited funds and adjust tower defense combinations according to enemy types is the key to victory, full of fun and challenges in strategic gaming.,['Simplified Chinese'],[],,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3740060/1a7418074c9102a4df434311b5fe6c9e8d36cb2e/header.jpg?t=1748518996,,,K920J58dl@163.com,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,Zhang Huiqin,Zhang Huiqin,Single-player,Family Sharing,Adventure,Casual,RPG,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3740060/edb622e2468a5cdb8f832e8213a15bebe951f873/ss_edb622e2468a5cdb8f832e8213a15bebe951f873.1920x1080.jpg?t=1748518996,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3740060/afca58de77b5f6703b089b09d86640240587469c/ss_afca58de77b5f6703b089b09d86640240587469c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1748518996,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3740060/7da4dd4424990bf504ab0c650c5fc04d12a5da04/ss_7da4dd4424990bf504ab0c650c5fc04d12a5da04.1920x1080.jpg?t=1748518996,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3740060/325d36731008e2b2e7b07dbfadc3a4dad7b4c64c/ss_325d36731008e2b2e7b07dbfadc3a4dad7b4c64c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1748518996,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3740060/d6520b1ed3b8fec4e5a093e6d37494dc6b9cd6c0/ss_d6520b1ed3b8fec4e5a093e6d37494dc6b9cd6c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1748518996,"
"3854040,BRUTALISMUS: Dystopia,Jul 31, 2025,0 - 0,0,0,1.39,0,1,Can you escape the structures of your own mind? Brutalismus is a short, first-person experience where you’ll explore the decaying remains of the mind of a brutalist architect fractured by his own obsessions. In this psychological walking simulator, vast empty plazas, towering monolithic structures, and impossible corridors reflect the unraveling of a haunted mind. As you move deeper, fragmented memories and scattered voices reveal a story of control, obsession, and madness. Concrete becomes both a symbol of power and a prison, as the boundaries between physical space and mental collapse dissolve. Inspired by games like: BABBDI, BLAME!, Bernband, Off-Peak, NaissanceE, Lorn’s Lure, Lorn’s Lure: Prologue, Manifold Garden, Infra, Interior Worlds, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, What Remains of Edith Finch, The Stanley Parable, The Beginner’s Guide, Dear Esther, Proteus, Scanner Sombre, Eastshade, Journey, Shape of the World, Kairo, Antichamber, The Witness, The Talos Principle, Ether One, Layers of Fear, Paratopic, Mind: Path to Thalamus, Asemblance, Obduction, The Longest Walk Features : Short, atmospheric experience: Designed to be completed in a single session. Brutalist architecture as protagonist: Explore striking environments inspired by Le Corbusier, Paul Rudolph, and forgotten modernist utopias. Environmental and fragmented storytelling: No HUD, no markers — only you and the echoes of a broken psyche. Minimalist ambient soundtrack to heighten the weight and beauty of abandoned structures. Can you tell the difference between concrete reality and the ruins of the mind? *Two background visuals in this game were created using AI tools.

"3297500,Carnegie,Apr 8, 2025,0 - 20000,0,0,9.99,0,0,You will compete against Andrew the Automata in this solo-only version of the game, which does not offer an online mode.  The game features the original graphics from the board game, with the objective of helping you learn the rules and enhance your skills. This game is inspired by the life of Andrew Carnegie, who was born in Scotland in 1835 and emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1848. Although Carnegie started his career as a telegraph operator, his role as a major player in the rise of the United States’ steel industry made him one of the richest men in the world and an icon of the American dream. Carnegie was also a benefactor and philanthropist. Upon his death in 1919, more than $350 million of his wealth was bequeathed to various foundations, with another $30 million going to various charities. His endowments created nearly 2,500 free public libraries that bear his name to this day: the Carnegie libraries. In  Carnegie , players will recruit employees and expand their businesses by investing in real estate, producing goods, developing transport technology, and creating transport chains across the United States. Perhaps they will even become illustrious benefactors who contribute to the country’s greatness through their deeds and generosity! The game takes place over 20 rounds, with players each having one turn per round. In each round the active player will choose one of four actions, which the other players will follow. The success of a player’s Company is represented by their victory points (VP), and the player with the most VP at the end of the game will be declared the winner, known forevermore for their philanthropic works. In this App version of the board game you will play vs. Andrew, the solo automata, with Four different level of difficulty.  The App includes a short tutorial which explain the basic concepts of the game to help the player dive in immediately, and a full set of written rules.

"1110050,Evan's Remains,Jun 11, 2020,200000 - 500000,2,0,1.39,0,1,Evan's Remains is a mystery-thriller puzzle adventure about finding a missing boy: Evan. The game combines logic-based platform puzzles with narrative inspired by Japanese graphic adventure games. Gameplay: Every time the player solves from two to three puzzles, the story goes forward and new mechanics are introduced. The challenge of the puzzles lies in the player’s ability to figure out what do rather than solve challenges based on skill. As the difficulty curve increases, the puzzles become more complex by combining two or more previously introduced mechanics. Story: Evan, the genius boy, has been missing for years. One day, a letter signed by him is received, claiming he’s on an uninhabited island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Nobody knows why, but he asked specifically for a girl named “Dysis” to go and look for him. The player will take control of this girl, who we don’t know much about.

Trapped in a manor accompanied by ghosts of an evil past, which truant the corridors and the great halls. They are never far behind you. Sending chills up your spine as your heart rate increases, this is a constant reminder that the ghosts are never far. Your aim is to escape the manor through the front door, with the items that are scattered around for you to collect. However, its not just the items that you need to collect to escape, as the door also has some puzzle elements. Any sound that you make will be heard by the ghosts, be careful to avoid standing on the broken glass and rubble as this will trigger the ghost to find you. Lastly the ghost can and will travel through walls, floors and doors, so there is no escape when she is on your tail. However, one old trick of hiding under the bed may keep you safe. You have 5 lives, good luck! Game modes I have added a number of game modes to be enjoyed, and a practice mode to explore the manor and locate the items without the ghost.

"2558620,Galvanized,Jun 17, 2025,0 - 20000,0,0,10.04,33,0,In order to pay off your family's' debt, you've relinquished your body to be resurrected as a killing machine. Centuries later, you wake up to a world that is physically broken in half, and a blight of undulating flesh is writhing from its core and overcoming the last remnants of civilization. As the Galvanized, it's all on you to beat back the flesh blight, and protect your city from the encroaching threat. Do you have what it takes, or will you be assimilated like the rest? Blast your way through gritty, brutalist settings and monsters far beyond even your darkest fears. Traverse this forboding terrain with a body of unfeeling steel and superhuman speed. Above all, if you wish to regain your material freedom, leave none of the weaker fleshnoid lifeforms in your wake... Galvanized will have an episodic single player campaign with a free demo, a format evocative of PC gaming's shareware era. Paid content will be released as Episodes which will be selectable from the main menu if you buy into Galvanized early access. The final game will feature 3 episodes in total where you discover this twisted world's origins, and who is truly to blame for its fate. Your new body will also feature advanced movement mechanics, like a thrusted dash and wall kicking, that will encourage speedy gameplay. A Galvanized warrior drone has a hefty arsenal at their disposal, but they must be recovered from the environment. There are alternate firing modes for each weapon. Try right clicking with each for a hefty variety of combat and movement options! Slag Gun - The primary fire punches 6 holes into a disk of compacted slag at supersonic speeds, creating a short range kinetic burst for for clearing your immediate surroundings. The alt-fire launches a grenade for lobbing around corners and behind enemy cover. Chain Gun - A rotary assault weapon fed by a quantum hypercapacity magazine designed to deliver a steady stream of hollow point ammunition to any cellular life the user wishes to shred. The alt-fire is a grappling chain that embeds itself into fleshy surfaces in the environment, you can raise or lower yourself on the chain with the scroll wheel for an extended range of movement. Rocket Gun - The primary fire delivers a payload of high explosive charges that are effective against foes with heavy armor or metalic bodies. The alt fire activates a spacetime moebius strip at the rocket's current position, essentially freezing it in mid air. Use this to charge a barage for clearing many enemies at once. Burr Gun - A mysterious flesh blight organism that turns out to make a great improvised weapon for the Galvanized. It spits a small spikey lifeform out of what most would assume is a mouth. The alt-fire allows the weilder to control the position of the Burr psychokinetically to pummel any target. The more lifeforms it spits out, the more effective the attack, however spawning these creatures takes time that must be used to evade enemy attack. Far Gun - A long range, rotary duel barreled rifle with sensor driven anti-recoil motors for pinpoint accuracy at 8,000 yards in any condition. The alt-fire brings up the scope to zoom in, go for headshots on unaware targets for maximum damage. There's many more weapons to come! As you engage the fleshy menace, you'll begin hearing voices within your mind. A particularly persistant one says, 'Do better.' This special time attack mode will allow you to race a ghost version of your best time in clearing a single player level.

"3371770,Funguys Swarm,Aug 21, 2025,0 - 20000,0,0,5.59,0,1,Funguys Swarm is a survivor-style roguelite where you play as forest weirdos fighting the Fire King’s flaming minions. Level up, unlock new heroes, pets, skills—even mechas—and rescue creatures to grow your Forest Sanctuary for permanent upgrades. Perfect for both newcomers and seasoned survivors! Choose from a cast of silly funguys, each with their quirky charm and unique abilities. Whether you like getting up close and personal or prefer to keep things tactical from afar, there’s a funguy for every playstyle. Face off against never-ending waves of flaming minions, mutated veggies, and things that probably shouldn’t be on fire. The longer you last, the weirder—and wilder—it gets. Grab upgrades mid-run and stack chaotic, over-the-top powers that turn your goofy forest friend into a full-blown nature-powered menace. A weapon to surpass the m.... menace of the fire king! Powered by the forest and questionable engineering. It probably shouldn’t work, but it does. Every now and then, the swarm throws a tantrum and sends in a giant boss.

So join Rowen and his (supposedly evil) twin brother Roger, as they travel to a strange country known only as the United States of America. While there, Rowen will enter a cooking show, mess with the mafia, help finish a movie, and escape from a hotel.

And yet, with only 30 days until his parents pick him up, is this one assignment he's fated to flunk, or will he pass with flying colors?
