        "summary": "Animals is the tenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 January 1977, by Harvest Records and Columbia Records. It was produced by the band at their new studio, Britannia Row Studios, in London throughout 1976. The album continued the long-form compositions of Pink Floyd's previous works, such as Meddle (1971) and Wish You Were Here (1975).\nAnimals is a concept album that focuses on the sociopolitical conditions of mid-1970s Britain. The cover was conceived by Roger Waters, the group's bassist and lead songwriter, and designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson. It shows an inflatable pig floating between two chimneys of Battersea Power Station.\nPink Floyd released no singles from Animals but promoted it through the In the Flesh tour. Waters' agitation with audiences during this tour inspired their next album, The Wall (1979). Animals reached number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the US. It initially received mixed reviews, but gained more favourable reviews in later years, and is considered by many to be one of Pink Floyd's greatest albums.",

                "content": "By 1975, Pink Floyd's deal with Harvest Records' parent company, EMI, for unlimited studio time in return for a reduced percentage of sales had expired. That year, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey block of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington, north London. They converted it into a recording studio and storage facility, which took up most of 1975. In April 1976, Pink Floyd started work on their tenth studio album, Animals, at the new facility. It was engineered by a previous Floyd collaborator, Brian Humphries. Recording took place at Britannia Row between April 1976 and early 1977.\nWith the exception of \"Dogs\" (co-written by David Gilmour), the tracks were written by Roger Waters. Keyboardist Richard Wright contributed less than on previous albums, and Animals was the first Pink Floyd album not to contain a composer's credit for Wright.\n\"Raving and Drooling\" and \"You've Got to Be Crazy\", songs previously performed live and considered for Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here, reappeared as \"Sheep\" and \"Dogs\". They were reworked to fit the new concept, and separated by \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\". The only other new composition, \"Pigs on the Wing\" (split into two parts to start and end the album), references Waters' private life; his new romantic interest was Carolyne Anne Christie, who was married to Rock Scully, the manager of the Grateful Dead, when she met Waters.\nThe band had discussed employing another guitarist for future tours, and Snowy White was invited into the studio. When Waters and Mason inadvertently erased one of Gilmour's guitar solos, White was asked to record a solo on \"Pigs on the Wing\". Although his performance was omitted from the vinyl release, it was included on the 8-track cartridge version. White performed on the Animals tour. Mason recalled enjoying working on Animals more than Wish You Were Here.",

                "content": "Loosely based on George Orwell's political fable Animal Farm, the album's lyrics describe various classes in society as different kinds of animals: the predatory dogs, the despotic ruthless pigs, and the \"mindless and unquestioning” herd of sheep. Whereas the novella focuses on Stalinism, the album is a critique of capitalism and differs again in that the sheep eventually rise up to overpower the dogs. The album was developed from a collection of unrelated songs into a concept which, in the words of author Glenn Povey, \"described the apparent social and moral decay of society, likening the human condition to that of mere animals\".\nThe album is also in part a response to the punk rock movement, which grew in popularity as a nihilistic statement against the prevailing social and political conditions, and in response to the complacency and nostalgia that appeared to surround rock music. Pink Floyd were a target for punk musicians, notably John Lydon of the Sex Pistols, who wore a Pink Floyd T-shirt on which the words \"I hate\" had been written in ink. Rotten since said this was a joke; he was a fan of several progressive rock bands, including Magma and Van der Graaf Generator. Mason later said he welcomed the \"punk rock insurrection\" as a return to the underground scene from which Pink Floyd originated. In 1977, Mason produced the Damned's second studio album, Music for Pleasure, at Britannia Row, after they failed to entice the retired Syd Barrett to the role.\n\nIn his 2008 book Comfortably Numb, Mark Blake argues that \"Dogs\" contains some of Gilmour's finest work; although he sings only one lead vocal, his performance is \"explosive\". The song also contains notable contributions from Wright, which echo the synthesiser sounds used on Wish You Were Here.\n\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\" is similar to \"Have a Cigar\", with bluesy guitar fills and elaborate bass lines. Of the song's three pigs, the only one directly identified is the morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who is described as a \"house-proud town mouse\".\n\"Sheep\" contains a modified version of Psalm 23, which continues the traditional \"the Lord is my shepherd\" with words like \"he maketh me to hang on hooks in high places and converteth me to lamb cutlets\". Towards the end of the song, the sheep rise up, kill the dogs and retire to their homes. Wright played the introduction unaccompanied on the electric piano, but did not receive a writing credit.\nThe album is bookended by each half of \"Pigs on the Wing\", a simple love song in which a glimmer of hope is offered despite the anger expressed in the other songs. Described by the author Andy Mabbett as \"in stark contrast to the heavyweight material between them\", the halves were influenced by Waters' relationship with his then wife.",

                "content": "Once the album was complete, work began on its cover. Hipgnosis, designer of the band's previous album covers, offered three ideas, one of which was a small child entering his parents' bedroom to find them having sex: \"copulating, like animals!\"\nThe final concept was, unusually, designed by Waters. At the time, he lived near Clapham Common, London, and regularly drove past Battersea Power Station, which was approaching the end of its useful life. A view of the building was chosen for the cover image, and the band commissioned the German company Ballon Fabrik (who had previously constructed Zeppelin airships) and the Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw to build a 12-metre (40 ft) pig balloon (known as Algie). The balloon was inflated with helium and manoeuvred into position on 2 December 1976, with a marksman ready to fire if it escaped.\nInclement weather delayed work, and the band's manager Steve O'Rourke neglected to book the marksman for the following day; the balloon broke free of its moorings and disappeared from view. The pig flew over Heathrow, resulting in panic and cancelled flights; pilots also spotted the pig in the air. It eventually landed in Kent and was recovered by a local farmer, who was apparently furious that it had scared his cows. The balloon was recovered and filming continued for a third day, but as the early photographs of the power station were considered better, the image of the pig was later superimposed onto one of those taken by professional photographer Howard Bartrop on location on a residential block of flats adjacent.\nDuring the Isles of Wonder short film shot by Danny Boyle and shown as part of the Opening Ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the camera zooms down the length of the River Thames, from a small spring in the countryside all the way to the Olympic venue. During the fly-by, a pig can be seen floating above Battersea Power Station.\nThe album's theme continues onto the record's picture labels. Side one's label shows a fisheye lens view of a dog and the English countryside, and side two features a pig and sheep, in the same setting. Mason's handwriting is used as a typeface throughout the packaging. The gatefold features monochrome photographs of the dereliction around the power station.",

The broadcast was originally to have been an exclusive for the DJ Nicky Horne, who since mid-December had been broadcasting The Pink Floyd Story, but a copy was given to John Peel, who played side one of the album in its entirety a day earlier.\nAnimals was released in the UK on 21 January 1977 on Harvest Records, and in the US on 12 February on Columbia Records. It reached number two in the UK and number three in the US. According to The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Pink Floyd overtook ABBA for the most weeks on the UK Albums Chart in 1977, at 108 weeks. Animals was certified quadruple platinum in the US on 31 January 1995.",

                "content": "Animals became the subject material for the band's In the Flesh Tour, which began in Dortmund on the same day the album was released. The tour continued through continental Europe in February, the UK in March, the United States for three weeks in April and May, and another three weeks in the United States in June and July. Algie became the inspiration for a number of pig themes used throughout. An inflatable pig was floated over the audience, and during each performance was replaced with a cheaper, but explosive version. On one occasion the mild propane gas was replaced with an oxygen-acetylene mixture, producing a massive (and dangerous) explosion. German promoter Marcel Avram presented the band with a piglet in Munich, only for it to leave a trail of broken mirrors and excrement across its mirrored hotel room, leaving manager O'Rourke to deal with the resulting fallout.\nThe band was augmented by familiar figures such as Dick Parry and Snowy White, but relations within the band became fraught. Waters took to arriving at the venues alone, departing as soon as each performance was over. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. The size of the venues was also an issue; in Chicago, the promoters claimed to have sold out the 67,000-person regular capacity of the Soldier Field stadium (after which ticket sales should have been ended), but Waters and O'Rourke were suspicious. They hired a helicopter, photographer and attorney, and discovered that the actual attendance was 95,000; a shortfall to the band of $640,000. The end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who felt that Pink Floyd had achieved the success they had sought and that there was nothing they could look forward to.\nIn July 1977 – on the final date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium – a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters to such an extent that he spat at one of them, which he later said he immediately regretted. Gilmour also felt depressed about playing to such large audiences, and refused to join his bandmates for their third encore. Waters later spoke with the producer Bob Ezrin and told him of his sense of alienation on the tour, and how he sometimes felt like building a wall to separate himself from the audience. The incident formed the concept for the next Pink Floyd album, The Wall.",

Rolling Stone's Frank Rose was unimpressed, writing: \"The 1977 Floyd has turned bitter and morose. They complain about the duplicity of human behavior (and then title their songs after animals – get it?). They sound like they've just discovered this – their message has become pointless and tedious.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a \"B+\" rating and found the negative reaction overly cynical, reasoning that the album functions simply as \"a piece of well-constructed political program music ... lyrical, ugly, and rousing, all in the right places\". Critic Mike Cormack said \"Shorn of the lush textures of Dark Side or Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd here are forbidding, stripped-down and muscular. Animals is to all intents and purposes their punk album; it has, with all deference to the Sex Pistols, a huge amount of bollocks. But it is largely undigestible by radio or compilation albums, and so it remains the lost great album of the Pink Floyd canon.\"",

We used those two tracks which went back to '74, changed the names, doctored them around and stuck them on the album. I love the album; it was exciting and noisy and fun. It really had some great bits and stuff of effects on there but it was not one of our creative high points really.\" Wright, on the BBC Omnibus Special in 1994, said: \"I didn't really like a lot of the music on the album. I didn't fight hard to put my stuff on the album and I didn't have anything to put on. I played well but did not contribute to the writing and also Roger was not letting me write. This was the whole start of the whole ego thing in the band, Animals.\"",

They headed back to London in early 1970 for rehearsals.

                        "content": "The title track of Atom Heart Mother resulted from a number of instrumental figures the band had composed during these rehearsals, including the chord progression of the main theme, which guitarist David Gilmour had called \"Theme from an Imaginary Western\", and the earliest documented live performance was on 17 January 1970 at Hull University. The band felt that the live performances developed the piece into a manageable shape. Recording of the track commenced at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London, and was somewhat cumbersome, as it was the first recording to use a new  eight-track one-inch tape and EMI TG12345 transistorised mixing console (8-track, 24-microphone inputs) in the studio. As a result, EMI insisted the band were not allowed to do any splicing of the tape to edit pieces together. Consequently, band members Roger Waters and Nick Mason had little choice but to play the bass and drums, respectively, for the entire 23-minute piece in one sitting. The other instruments the band played were overdubbed later. Mason recalled the final backing track's lack of precise timekeeping would cause problems later on. Geesin denied Mason's account and said the tapes given to him for arranging the score were a collage of short sections.\nBy March, they had finished recording the track, but felt that it was rather unfocused and needed something else. The band had been introduced to Ron Geesin via the Rolling Stones tour manager, Sam Cutler, and were impressed with his composition and tape-editing capabilities, particularly Waters and Mason. Geesin was handed the completed backing tracks the band had recorded, and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over the top of it while the band went on tour to the US. Geesin described the composing and arranging as \"a hell of a lot of work. Nobody knew what was wanted, they couldn't read music …\" According to him, Gilmour came up with some of the melodic lines, while the pair of them along with keyboardist Richard Wright worked on the middle section with the choir. During the recording of his work in June with the EMI Pops Orchestra, the session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant-garde music over established classical works, and, combined with the relative difficulty of some of the parts, harassed him during recording. John Alldis, whose choir was also to perform on the track, had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians, and managed to conduct the recorded performance in place of Geesin.\nThe track was originally called \"The Amazing Pudding\", although Geesin's original score referred to it as \"Untitled Epic\". A refined and improved version (with Geesin's written parts) was played at Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on 27 June. Its name was changed after the band were due to play an \"in concert\" broadcast for BBC Radio 1 on 16 July 1970, and had needed a title for John Peel to announce it. Geesin pointed to a copy of the Evening Standard, and suggested to Waters that he would find a title in there. The headline of one article, on page 9, was: \"ATOM HEART MOTHER NAMED\", a story about a woman being fitted with a Plutonium-238-powered pacemaker.\nThe piece as presented on the completed album is a progression from Pink Floyd's earlier instrumental pieces such as \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" and even earlier, \"Interstellar Overdrive\". The \"Atom Heart Mother\" suite takes up all of side one, and is split into six parts, individually named. Geesin chose the opening section name, \"Father's Shout\" after Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, while other names such as \"Breast Milky\" and \"Funky Dung\" were inspired by the album cover artwork. The orchestral arrangements feature a full brass section, a cello and the 16-piece John Alldis choir, which take most of the lead melody lines, while Pink Floyd mainly provide the backing tracks; a reverse of the 1960s pop music practice of using orchestration as the background, and putting the rock band in front.",

                        "content": "The album's concept is similar to their previous Ummagumma album, in that it features the full band in the first half, and focuses on individual members in the second half. Side two opens with three five-minute songs: one by each of the band's three resident songwriters; then closes with a sound effects-dominated musical suite primarily conceived by Mason  and credited to the whole group.  Waters contributes a folk ballad called \"If\", playing acoustic guitar. Pink Floyd rarely played the song live, but Waters often  performed it at solo shows in support of his Radio K.A.O.S. album, more than a decade later. This is followed by Wright's \"Summer '68\", which also features prominent use of brass in places. It was issued as a Japanese single in 1971, and was the only track on the album never to be played live in concert. The song was reportedly about Wright and a groupie on tour, and had the working title of \"One Night Stand\".\nAccording to Mason, Gilmour, having had little songwriting experience at that point, was ordered to remain in EMI until he had composed a song suitable for inclusion on the album. He came up with a folk-influenced tune, \"Fat Old Sun\", which he still cites as a personal favourite. The song was a regular part of the band's live repertoire in 1970–71, and became a staple of Gilmour's solo set in 2006.\nThe final track, \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\", is divided into three segments, each with its own descriptive title, joined by dialogue and sound effects of then-roadie Alan Styles preparing, discussing, and eating breakfast. The idea for the piece came about by Waters experimenting with the rhythm of a dripping tap, which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by Mason in his kitchen with musical pieces recorded at EMI. A slightly re-worked version was performed on stage on 22 December 1970 at Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, England with the band members pausing between pieces to eat and drink their breakfast. The original LP ends with the sound of the tap which continues into the inner groove, and thus plays on indefinitely.\nOriginal Floyd frontman Syd Barrett recorded his album Barrett around the same time as Atom Heart Mother, with assistance from Gilmour and Wright. He occasionally visited his old band's sessions to see what they were doing.",

                "content": "The original album cover, designed by art collective Hipgnosis, shows a Holstein-Friesian cow standing in a pasture with no text nor any other clue as to what might be on the record. Some later editions have the title and artist name added to the cover. This concept was the group's reaction to the psychedelic space rock imagery associated with Pink Floyd at the time of the album's release; the band wanted to explore all sorts of music without being limited to a particular image or style of performance. They thus requested that their new album had \"something plain\" on the cover, which ended up being the image of a cow. Storm Thorgerson, inspired by Andy Warhol's famous \"cow wallpaper\", has said that he simply drove out into a rural area near Potters Bar and photographed the first cow he saw. The cow's owner identified her name as \"Lulubelle III\". More cows appear on the back cover, again with no text or titles, and on the inside gatefold. Also, a pink balloon shaped like a cow udder accompanied the album as part of Capitol's marketing strategy campaign to \"break\" the band in the US. Looking back on the artwork, Thorgerson remembered: \"I think the cow represents, in terms of the Pink Floyd, part of their humour, which I think is often underestimated or just unwritten about.\"\nIn the mid-1980s, a bootleg containing rare singles and B-sides entitled The Dark Side of the Moo appeared, with a similar cover. Like Atom Heart Mother, the cover had no writing on it, although in this case it was to protect the bootlegger's anonymity rather than any artistic statement. The album cover for the KLF's concept album Chill Out was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.",

It was released in the quadraphonic format in the UK, Germany and Australia. A remastered CD was released in 1994 in the UK and the US. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a 24KT gold CD in the US in 1994, while an LP version was released in the US in the same year. A remastered edition was released in 2011. It was reissued again in 2016 on the band's Pink Floyd Records label.\nCritical reaction to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it. Gilmour has said the album was \"a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period\" and \"a good idea but it was dreadful... Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it.\" Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said \"If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, go out and play Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking.\"\nIn a 1970 review, Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone appraised Atom Heart Mother negatively, stating \"if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here.\" In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said the suite was easier to digest than the second side of songs: \"Yeah, they do leave the singing to an anonymous semi-classical chorus, and yeah, they probably did get the horns for the fanfares at the same hiring hall. But at least the suite provides a few of the hypnotic melodies that made Ummagumma such an admirable record to fall asleep to.\" The album is ranked number 990 in All-Time Top 1000 Albums.\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album \"the most impenetrable album Pink Floyd released while on Harvest,\" and said it was \"often intriguing, more in what it suggests than what it achieves.\" He suggested that the album's 23-minute long opening track could prove to make the album an \"acquired taste\" to even hardened fans of the band.",

                "content": "The band were initially enthusiastic about performing the suite. An early performance was taped for the San Francisco television station KQED, featuring just the band, on 28 April 1970. Two major performances were at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on 27 June and the \"Blackhills Garden Party\" in Hyde Park, London on 18 July. On both occasions the band were accompanied by the John Alldis Choir and the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble. Later, the band took a full brass section and choir on tour just for the purpose of performing this piece. However, this caused the tour to lose money, and the band found problems with the hired musicians, which changed from gig to gig as they simply took who was available, which, combined with lack of rehearsal and problems miking up the whole ensemble, made a full live performance more problematic. Reflecting on this, Gilmour said \"some of the brass players have been really hopeless\". According to Mason, the band arrived at one gig in Aachen, Germany, only to discover they had left the sheet music behind, forcing tour manager Tony Howard to go back to London and get it.\nA later arrangement without brass or choir, and pared down from 25 minutes to fifteen by omitting the \"collage\" sections and closing reprise of the main theme, remained in their live repertoire into 1972. The first live performance of The Dark Side of the Moon suite in Brighton was abandoned partway through; after a break, the band played Atom Heart Mother instead. Pink Floyd's last live performance of the suite took place on 22 May 1972 at the Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\nThe title track was performed live by Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra in Paris on 12 January 2012 with Ron Geesin playing piano.  This was made available on YouTube on 23 July 2024",

In retrospect, Waters said \"maybe it's just as well it wasn't used after all\". Nevertheless, the album is visible behind the counter in the record store scene of the film.\nOn 14 and 15 June 2008, Geesin performed \"Atom Heart Mother\" with Italian tribute band Mun Floyd over two nights as part of the Chelsea Festival. Geesin introduced it with a history and slide show. The performances featured the chamber choir Canticum, brass and cellist Caroline Dale, who has worked with Gilmour. The second night saw Gilmour join Geesin on stage for the performance, which was extended to 30 minutes.\nIn 2013, Geesin produced a book, The Flaming Cow, which documented his experience with working with Pink Floyd, including the making of this album from his point of view.\nMusic critic Jim DeRogatis called the album the \"strongest offering from the mid-period Floyd.\"",

        "summary": "Pink Floyd bootleg recordings are the collections of audio and video recordings of musical performances by the English rock band Pink Floyd, which were never officially released by the band. The recordings consist of both live performances and outtakes from studio sessions unavailable in official releases. In some cases, certain bootleg recordings may be highly prized among collectors, as at least 40 songs composed by Pink Floyd have never been officially released.\nDuring the 1970s, bands such as Pink Floyd created a lucrative market for the mass production of unofficial recordings with large followings of fans willing to purchase them. In addition, the huge crowds that turned up to these concerts made the effective policing of the audience for the presence of recording equipment virtually impossible. Vast numbers of recordings were issued for profit by bootleg labels.\nSome Pink Floyd bootlegs exist in several variations with differing sound quality and length because sometimes listeners have recorded different versions of the same performance at the same time. Pink Floyd was a group that protected its sonic performance, making recording with amateur recording devices difficult. In their career, Pink Floyd played over 1,300 concerts, of which more than 350 were released as bootlegged recordings (sometimes in various versions). Few concerts have ever been broadcast (or repeated once they were broadcast on television), especially during 'the golden age' of the group from 1966 to 1981.\nPink Floyd was one of the mainstays of the bootleg industry in the 1970s. In 1999, the group was mentioned on BPI's list of most bootlegged British artists of all time.\nOne of the best known ROIO's by Pink Floyd is Best of Tour '72: Live at the Rainbow Theatre with a concert performed on 20 February 1972. This bootleg includes one of the first performances of The Dark Side of the Moon. One year and one month before the official release of that same album, the bootleg had already sold over 120,000 copies.\nIn 2008, the Pink Floyd bootleg Madison Square Garden, New York, NY – 2 July 1977 was mentioned on the Yahoo's Top 10 of Best Bootlegs of All Time.",

Almost simultaneously, a 15-track bootleg CD of the complete sessions appeared that revealed additional works in progress, among them a track that was long referred to by Pink Floyd as \"The Violent Sequence\". It was penned by Richard Wright for a riot scene in the movie and although unreleased in any form officially, was incorporated into their live set as an acoustic piano piece in the early part of the year.

        "summary": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Capitol Records in the US and on 16 March 1973 by Harvest Records in the UK. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of the former band member Syd Barrett, who had departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.\nThe record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised the band's earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. The engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of the session singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to the keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design which would represent the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon received acclaim and is often featured in publication listings of the greatest albums of all time. It brought international fame and wealth to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. The Dark Side of the Moon is certified 14× platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, where it has charted for 996 weeks. By 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon had sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the band's best-selling release, the best-selling album of the 1970s, and the fourth-best-selling album in history. In 2012, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.",

                "content": "Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States that December. In a band meeting at the home of the drummer, Nick Mason, in North London, the bassist, Roger Waters, proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters conceived an album that dealt with things that \"make people mad\", focusing on the pressures associated with the band's arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the mental health problems suffered by the former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with the 1969 concert suite The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, the guitarist, David Gilmour, said: \"I think we all thought –  and Roger definitely thought –  that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.\"\n\nThe band approved of Waters' concept for an album unified by a single theme . Waters created demo tracks in a small studio in a garden shed at his home in Islington. Parts of the album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of \"Breathe\" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and the basic structure of \"Us and Them\" was borrowed from an original composition, \"The Violent Sequence\", by the keyboardist, Richard Wright, for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by the Rolling Stones and at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries. This would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). After discovering that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material was premiered at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.\n\nDark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known, was performed for an assembled press on 17 February 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, more than a year before its release, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as \"bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\" Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote \"The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\" Melody Maker was less enthusiastic: \"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London Zoo.\" The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually sequenced on the album. Differences included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as \"On the Run\", and Clare Torry's vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" replaced by readings from the Bible.\nPink Floyd's lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded music for the French director Barbet Schroeder's film La Vallée. They performed in Japan, returned to France in March to complete work on the film, played more shows in North America, then flew to London and resumed recording in May and June. After more concerts in Europe and North America, the band returned to London on 9 January 1973 to complete the album.",

                "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon was built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, although it lacked the extended instrumental excursions which, according to the critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band following the departure of the founding member Syd Barrett in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as \"that psychedelic noodling stuff\". He and Waters cited 1971's Meddle as a turning point towards what would later be realised on the album. The Dark Side of the Moon's lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death and insanity, the last inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state. The album contains musique concrète on several tracks.\nEach side of the vinyl album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience and, according to Waters, \"empathy\". \"Speak to Me\" and \"Breathe\" together highlight the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life –  \"Don't be afraid to care\". By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental \"On the Run\" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. \"Time\" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane pursuits; it is concluded with a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in the reprise of \"Breathe\". The first side of the album ends with Wright and Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\n\"Money\", the first track on side two, opens with the sound of cash registers and rhythmically jingling coins. The song mocks greed and consumerism with sarcastic lyrics and cash-related sound effects. \"Money\" became the band's most commercially successful track and was covered by other artists. \"Us and Them\" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. \"Any Colour You Like\" tackles the illusion of choice one has in society. \"Brain Damage\" looks at mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line \"and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes\" reflects the mental breakdown of Syd Barrett. The album ends with \"Eclipse\", which espouses the concepts of otherness and unity while encouraging the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.",

                "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon was recorded at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in approximately 60 days between 31 May 1972 and 9 February 1973.  Pink Floyd were assigned staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as the assistant tape operator on their fifth album, Atom Heart Mother (1970), and had gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles albums Abbey Road and Let It Be. The Dark Side of the Moon sessions made use of advanced studio techniques, especially the Studer A80 16-track recorders, an appreciable advantage over the eight- or four-track recordings they'd previously made, although the band often used so many tracks that second-generation copies were still needed to make more space available on the tape. The mix supervisor Chris Thomas recalled later, \"There were only two or three tracks of drums when we came to mixing it. Depending on the song, there would be one or two tracks of guitar, and these would include the solo and the rhythm guitar parts. One track for keyboard, one track for bass, and one or two sound effects tracks. They had been very, very efficient in the way they'd worked.\"\nThe first track recorded was \"Us and Them\" on 31 May, followed seven days later by \"Money\". For \"Money\", Waters had created effects loops in an unusual 74 time signature from recordings of money-related objects, including coins thrown into a mixing bowl in his wife's pottery studio. These were re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to create a quadraphonic mix of the album, although Parsons later expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, which he attributed to a lack of time and a shortage of multitrack tape recorders.\n\"Time\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" were recorded next, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for a tour of the United States. The recording sessions were frequently interrupted: Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on television while Parsons worked on the tracks. Gilmour recalled, \"...but when we were on a roll, we would get on.\"\n\nAfter returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\", \"Any Colour You Like\" and \"On the Run\", and fine-tuned work from previous sessions. Four female vocalists were assembled to sing on \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\" and \"Time\", and the saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on \"Us and Them\" and \"Money\". With the director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. The album was completed and signed off at Abbey Road on 9 February 1973. Gilmour recalled the band listening to the finished album for the first time as \"a moment of great joy and of satisfaction and the feeling of achievement that we'd really gone that extra mile\".",

                        "content": "The album features metronomic sound effects during \"Speak to Me\" and tape loops for the opening of \"Money\". Mason created a rough version of \"Speak to Me\" at his home before completing it in the studio. The track serves as an overture and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album. A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of \"Breathe\". Mason received a rare solo composing credit for \"Speak to Me\".\nThe sound effects on \"Money\" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a 7-beat effects loop. This was later adapted to four tracks to create a \"walk around the room\" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album. At times, the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the studio engineers and all four band members to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs, particularly \"On the Run\".\nAlong with conventional rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd introduced prominent synthesisers to their sound. The band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on \"Brain Damage\" and \"Any Colour You Like\", and a Synthi A on \"Time\" and \"On the Run\". They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as assistant engineer Peter James running around the studio's echo chamber during \"On the Run\", and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat during \"Speak to Me\", \"On the Run\", \"Time\" and \"Eclipse\". This heartbeat is most prominent in the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on \"Time\" and \"On the Run\". \"Time\" features assorted clocks ticking, then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of Rototoms. The recordings were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop. Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.",

                        "content": "Several tracks, including \"Us and Them\" and \"Time\", demonstrated Wright's and Gilmour's ability to harmonise their similar-sounding voices, and engineer Alan Parsons used techniques such as double tracking vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. Prominent use was also made of flanging and phase-shifting on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels, most notably in the quadraphonic mix of \"On the Run\", where the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker swirls around the listener.\n\nWright's \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" features Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter and a regular at Abbey Road. Parsons liked her voice, and when the band decided to use a female vocalist he suggested that she could sing on the track. The band explained the album concept to her, but they were unable to tell her exactly what she should do, and Gilmour, who was in charge of the session, asked her to try to express emotions rather than sing words. In a few takes on a Sunday night, Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth and wanted to apologise to the band, who were impressed with her performance but did not tell her so. Her takes were edited to produce the version used on the track. She left the studio under the impression that her vocals would not make the final cut, and she only became aware that she had been included in the final mix when she picked up the album at a local record store and saw her name in the credits. For her contribution she was paid her standard session fee of £30, equivalent to about £500 in 2023.\nIn 2004, Torry sued EMI and Pink Floyd for 50% of the songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry jointly.\nIn the final week of recording, Waters asked staff and others at Abbey Road to respond to questions printed on flashcards and some of their replies were edited into the final mix. The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3 and shown such questions as \"What's your favourite colour?\" and \"What's your favourite food?\", before moving on to themes central to the album, including those of madness, violence, and death. Questions such as \"When was the last time you were violent?\", followed immediately by \"Were you in the right?\", were answered in the order they were presented.\nRoadie Roger \"The Hat\" Manifold was recorded in a conventional sit-down interview. Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with a motorist, and Manifold replied \"... give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock ...\" Asked about death, he responded, \"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me ...\" Another roadie, Chris Adamson, recorded the words that open the album: \"I've been mad for fucking years. Absolutely years. Over the edge... It's working with bands that does it.\"\nThe band's road manager Peter Watts (father of the actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during \"Brain Damage\" and \"Speak to Me\", as  well as the line \"I can't think of anything to say\". His second wife, Patricia \"Puddie\" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the \"geezer\" who was \"cruisin' for a bruisin'\", used in the segue between \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\", and the words \"I never said I was frightened of dying\" halfway through \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\nSeveral of the responses – \"I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do, I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it  ... you've got to go sometime\"; \"I know I've been mad, I've always been mad, like most of us have\"; and the closing \"There is no dark side in the moon really. Matter of fact, it's all dark\" – came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. \"The bit you don't hear,\" said Parsons, \"is that, after that, he said, 'The only thing that makes it look alight is the sun.' The band were too overjoyed with his first line, and it would have been an anticlimax to continue.\"\nPaul and Linda McCartney were interviewed, but their answers – judged to be \"trying too hard to be funny\" – were not used. The McCartneys' Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line, \"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time.\"",

Thomas's background was in music rather than engineering; he had worked with Beatles producer George Martin and was an acquaintance of Pink Floyd's manager, Steve O'Rourke. The members of the band were said to have disagreed over the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a \"dry\" and \"clean\" mix that made more use of the non-musical elements and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more \"echoey\" mix. Thomas said later, \"There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun.\"\nThomas's intervention resulted in a compromise between Waters and Gilmour, who were both satisfied with the result. Thomas was responsible for significant changes, including the perfect timing of the echo used on \"Us and Them\". He was also present for the recording of \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". Waters said in an interview in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio:\n\nWhen the record was finished I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, \"This has obviously struck a chord somewhere\", and I was kinda pleased by that.  You know when you've done something, certainly if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else.  And at that point I thought to myself, \"Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work\", and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.",

                "content": "The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism, as they were employed by the band. For The Dark Side of the Moon, Wright suggested something \"smarter, neater –  more classy\", and simple, \"like the artwork of a Black Magic chocolate box\".\nThe design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a beam of white light projected through it and emerging in the colours of the visible spectrum that Thorgerson had found in a 1963 physics textbook, as well as by an illustration by Alex Steinweiss, the inventor of album cover art, for the New York Philharmonic's 1942 performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. The artwork was created by an associate of Hipgnosis, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered a choice of seven designs for the sleeve, but all four members of the band agreed that the prism was the best. \"There were no arguments,\" said Roger Waters. \"We all pointed to the prism and said 'That's the one'.\"\nThe design depicts a glass prism dispersing white light into colours and represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design. At Waters' suggestion, the spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, to make possible interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing indigo, compared with the usual division of the visible spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.  Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.\nThe band were so confident of the quality of Waters' lyrics that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve.",

                "content": "As the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was played over a poor-quality public address system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Maker's Roy Hollingworth described Side One as \"so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow\", but praised Side Two, writing: \"The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night.\" Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: \"I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon\". In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side \"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement\". In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clichéd and its music pretentious, but called it a \"kitsch masterpiece\" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973, and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour. In Canada, it was in the top three for 22 weeks between May 5 and September 29, 1973.",

                        "content": "Much of the album's early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, Capitol Records. Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's 1971 studio album Meddle. Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records. The Dark Side of the Moon was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract. Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of \"Us and Them\" and \"Time\".\nIn some countries –  notably the UK –  Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's \"Point Me at the Sky\", and unusually \"Money\" was released as a single on 7 May, with \"Any Colour You Like\" on the B-side. It reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1973. A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had the word \"bullshit\" removed from the song –  leaving \"bull\" in its place –  however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version. This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy. On 4 February 1974, a double A-side single was released with \"Time\" on one side, and \"Us and Them\" on the opposite side. Menon's efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by Harvest Records).",

Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, it remained in the Billboard 200 albums chart for 736 nonconsecutive weeks (from 17 March 1973 to 16 July 1988). Of those first 736 charted weeks, the album had two notable consecutive runs in the Billboard 200 chart: 84 weeks (from 17 March 1973 to 19 October 1974) and 593 weeks (from 18 December 1976 to 23 April 1988). It made its final appearance in the Billboard 200 albums chart during its initial run on the week ending 8 October 1988, in its 741st charted week. It re-appeared on the Billboard charts with the introduction of the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in the issue dated 25 May 1991, and was still a perennial feature ten years later. It reached number one on the Pop Catalog chart when the 2003 hybrid CD/SACD edition was released and sold 800,000 copies in the US. On the week of 5 May 2006 The Dark Side of the Moon achieved a combined total of 1,716 weeks on the Billboard 200 and Pop Catalog charts.\nAfter a change in chart methodology in 2009, which allowed catalogue titles to be included in the Billboard 200, The Dark Side of the Moon returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week. It has continued to sporadically appear on the Billboard 200 since then, with the total at 996 weeks on the chart as of January 2026. \"On a slow week\" between 8,000 and 9,000 copies are sold. As of April 2013, the album had sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for Billboard. In 2007, one in every fourteen people in the US under the age of 50 was estimated to have owned a copy.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was released before the introduction of platinum certification in 1976 by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and therefore held only a gold certification until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11 times platinum. On 4 June 1998, the RIAA certified the album 15× platinum, denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States. This makes it Pink Floyd's biggest-selling work there; The Wall is 23 times platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5 million. \"Money\" has sold well as a single, and as with \"Time\", remains a radio favourite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, \"Time\" was played on 13,723 occasions, and \"Money\" on 13,731 occasions. In 2017, The Dark Side of the Moon was the seventh-bestselling album of all time in the UK and the highest-selling album never to reach number one. As one of the blockbuster LPs of the album era (1960s–2000s), The Dark Side of the Moon also led to an increase in record sales overall into the late 1970s. In 2013, industry sources suggested that worldwide sales of The Dark Side of the Moon totalled about 45 million.In 1993, Gilmour attributed the album's success to the combination of music, lyrics and cover art: \"All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise.\" Mason said that, when they finished the album, Pink Floyd felt confident it was their best work to date, but were surprised by its commercial success. He said it was \"not only about being a good album but also about being in the right place at the right time\".",

For the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix, and instead had the engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1 channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters' In the Flesh for SACD. In 2003, Parsons expressed disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting he was \"possibly a little too true to the original mix\", but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and sold more than 800,000 copies.\nThe cover image of the 30th-anniversary edition was created by a team of designers including Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the \"sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound ...\" The image was created out of a desire to be \"the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new\".",

                "content": "The success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. The group were fans of the British  comedy troupe Monty Python, and as such, some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with The Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success, Mason praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\"\nPart of the legacy of The Dark Side of the Moon is its influence on modern music and on the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs. It is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes made with Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, including a premise explored by Ben Schleifer in 'Speak to Me': The Legacy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (2006) that the two albums share a theme that \"the creative individual loses the ability to function in the [modern] world\".\nIn a 2018 book about classic rock, Steven Hyden recalls concluding, in his teens, that The Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV were the two greatest albums of the genre, vision quests \"encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire\". They had similarities, in that both albums' cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favour of \"inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning (which always seemed to give the music packaged inside more meaning)\". But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward \"conquering the world\" and were known at the time for their outrageous sexual antics on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward \"overcoming your own hang-ups\". In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",

        "summary": "The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 28 March 1994 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and on 5 April by Columbia Records in the United States.\nThe second Pink Floyd album recorded without the founder member Roger Waters, The Division Bell was written mostly by the guitarist and singer, David Gilmour, and the keyboardist, Richard Wright. It features Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). Gilmour's fiancée, the novelist Polly Samson, co-wrote many of the lyrics, which deal with themes of communication. It was the last Pink Floyd studio album to be composed of entirely new material, and the last recorded with Wright, who died in 2008.\nRecording took place in locations including Pink Floyd's Britannia Row Studios and Gilmour's houseboat, Astoria. The production team included longtime Pink Floyd collaborators such as the producer Bob Ezrin, the engineer Andy Jackson, the saxophonist Dick Parry and the bassist Guy Pratt.\nThe Division Bell received mixed reviews, but reached number one in more than 10 countries, including the UK and the US. In the US, it was certified double platinum in 1994 and triple platinum in 1999. To promote the album, the band embarked on the Division Bell Tour two days after its release, with concerts in North America and Europe; the tour sold more than 5 million tickets and made around $100 million in gross income. Pulse, a live album and video recorded during the final London dates, was released in 1995. Unused material from the album sessions became part of Pink Floyd's next album, The Endless River (2014).",

                "content": "In January 1993, guitarist David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright began improvising new material in sessions at the remodelled Britannia Row Studios. They recruited bassist Guy Pratt, who had joined Pink Floyd on their Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour; according to Mason, Pratt's playing influenced the mood of the music. Without the legal problems that had dogged the production of their 1987 album A Momentary Lapse of Reason, Gilmour was at ease. If he felt the band were making progress, he would record them on a two-track DAT recorder. At one point, Gilmour surreptitiously recorded Wright playing, capturing material that formed the basis for three pieces of music.\nAfter about two weeks, the band had around 65 pieces of music. With engineer Andy Jackson and co-producer Bob Ezrin, production moved to Gilmour's houseboat and recording studio, Astoria. The band voted on each track, and whittled the material down to about 27 pieces. Eliminating some tracks, and merging others, they arrived at about 11 songs. Song selection was based upon a system of points, whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song, a system skewed by Wright awarding his songs ten points each and the others none. Wright, having resigned under pressure from the bassist, Roger Waters, in 1979, was not contractually a full member of the band, which upset him. Wright reflected: \"It came very close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album, because I didn't feel that what we'd agreed was fair.\" Wright received his first songwriting credits on any Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here.\n\nGilmour's fiancée, the novelist Polly Samson, also received songwriting credits. Initially, her role was limited to providing encouragement for Gilmour, but she helped him write \"High Hopes\", a song about Gilmour's childhood in Cambridge. She co-wrote a further six songs, which bothered Ezrin. Gilmour said that Samson's contributions had \"ruffled the management's [feathers]\", but Ezrin later reflected that her presence had been inspirational for Gilmour, and that she \"pulled the whole album together\". She also helped Gilmour with the cocaine addiction he had developed following his divorce. Samson did not want credit, saying \"the idea of my name being attached to Pink Floyd was like some nightmare\", but Gilmour insisted, telling her she would regret going uncredited. She later said he was right, and that she had become used to him singing her lyrics.\nThe keyboardist Jon Carin, the percussionist Gary Wallis, backing vocalists including Sam Brown and the Momentary Lapse tour singer Durga McBroom were brought in before recording began. The band moved to Olympic Studios and recorded most of the tracks over the space of a week. After a summer break, they returned to Astoria to record more backing tracks. Ezrin worked on the drum sounds, and the Pink Floyd collaborator Michael Kamen provided the string arrangements, which were recorded at Abbey Road Studio Two by Steve McLaughlin. Dick Parry played saxophone on his first Pink Floyd album for almost 20 years, on \"Wearing the Inside Out\", and Chris Thomas created the final mix. \nWith the aid of Gilmour's guitar technician, Phil Taylor, Carin located some of Pink Floyd's older keyboards from storage, including a Farfisa organ. Sounds sampled from these instruments were used on \"Take It Back\" and \"Marooned\". Additional keyboards were played by Carin, along with Bob Ezrin. Durga McBroom supplied backing vocals alongside Sam Brown, Carol Kenyon, Jackie Sheridan, and Rebecca Leigh-White. \"What Do You Want from Me\" was influenced by Chicago blues, and \"Poles Apart\" contains folksy overtones. Gilmour's improvised guitar solos on \"Marooned\" used a DigiTech Whammy pedal to pitch-shift the guitar notes over an octave. On \"Take It Back\", he used a Gibson J-200 guitar through a Zoom effects unit, played with an EBow, an electronic device which produces sounds similar to a bow.\nBetween September and December recording and mixing sessions were held at Metropolis Studios in Chiswick and the Creek Recording Studios in London. In September, Pink Floyd performed at a celebrity charity concert at Cowdray House, in Midhurst. The album was mastered at the Mastering Lab in Los Angeles, by Doug Sax and James Guthrie.\nJackson edited unused material from the Division Bell sessions, described by Mason as ambient music, into an hour-long composition tentatively titled The Big Spliff, but Pink Floyd did not release it. Some of The Big Spliff was used to create the next Pink Floyd album, The Endless River (2014).",

                "content": "The Division Bell deals with themes of communication and the idea that talking can solve many problems. In the Studio radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offers \"the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace\". Songs such as \"Poles Apart\" and \"Lost for Words\" have been interpreted by fans and critics as references to the estrangement between Pink Floyd and their former member Roger Waters, who left in 1985, however Gilmour denied this and said: \"People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways but it's a little late at this point for us to be conjuring Roger up.\" The title refers to the division bell rung in the British parliament to announce a vote. Mason said: \"It's about people making choices, yeas or nays.\"\nProduced a few years after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, \"A Great Day for Freedom\" juxtaposes the general euphoria of the fall of the Berlin Wall with the subsequent wars and ethnic cleansing, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. Audio samples of Stephen Hawking, originally recorded for a BT television advertisement, were used in \"Keep Talking\"; Gilmour was so moved by Hawking's sentiment in the advert that he contacted the advertising company for permission to use the recordings. Mason said it felt \"politically incorrect to take ideas from advertising but it seemed a very relevant piece\". At the end of the album, Gilmour's stepson Charlie is heard hanging up the telephone receiver on Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke, who had pleaded to be allowed to appear on a Pink Floyd album.",

By January of that year, however, the band still had not decided on an album title. Titles considered included Pow Wow and Down to Earth. At a dinner one night, writer Douglas Adams, spurred by the promise of a payment to his favourite charity, the Environmental Investigation Agency, suggested The Division Bell, a term which appears in \"High Hopes\".\nPink Floyd's longtime collaborator Storm Thorgerson created the album artwork. He erected two large metal heads, each the height of a double-decker bus, in a field near Stuntney, Cambridgeshire. The sculptures were positioned together and photographed in profile, and can be seen as two faces talking to each other or as a single, third face. Thorgerson said the \"third absent face\" was a reference to Syd Barrett. The sculptures were devised by Keith Breeden, and constructed by John Robertson. Ely Cathedral is visible on the horizon. The pictures were shot in February for optimal lighting conditions. In 2001, the sculptures were in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2017, they were moved to the London Victoria and Albert Museum for display in a Pink Floyd exhibition. An alternate version of the cover photo, featuring two 7.5-metre (25 ft) stone sculptures by Aden Hynes, was used on the compact cassette release and the tour brochure.",

A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted to look like a fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.\nDuring the Division Bell tour, an anonymous person using the name Publius posted on an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the album. The message was verified during a show in East Rutherford, where lights in front of the stage spelled \"Enigma Publius\". During a televised concert at Earls Court, London, in October 1994, the word \"enigma\" was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. The riddle has never been solved. Gilmour and Mason later said it was created as a marketing ploy by EMI. According to Mason, the prize was to be \"a crop of trees planted in a clear-cut area of forest or something to that effect ... a touchy-feely sort of gift that was more of a philanthropic thing than something you could hang on the wall\".",

In the US, it was certified gold and double platinum on 6 June 1994, and triple platinum on 29 January 1999.\nIn the United States the album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 during the week of 23 April 1994 selling more than 460,000 units, at the time it was the 12th largest single-week total since Billboard began using SoundScan data in May 1991 and also became the fifth-largest first-week sales sum back then. The next week it stayed at the top of the chart selling a little less than half its first-week total, it moved 226,000 units during its second week on chart.

Songs from Wish You Were Here and The Wall were featured, as well as the whole Dark Side of the Moon. Backing musicians included Sam Brown, Jon Carin, Claudia Fontaine, Durga McBroom, Dick Parry, Guy Pratt, Tim Renwick, and Gary Wallis.\nThe tour continued in the US through April, May and mid-June, before moving to Canada, and then returning to the US in July. As the tour reached Europe in late July, Waters declined an invitation to join the band, and later expressed his annoyance that Pink Floyd songs were being performed again in large venues. On the first night of the UK leg of the tour on 12 October, a 1,200-capacity stand collapsed, but with no serious injuries; the performance was rescheduled.\nThe tour ended at Earls Court on 29 October 1994, and was Pink Floyd's final concert performance until Live 8 in 2005. Estimates placed the total number of tickets sold at over 5.3 million, and gross income at about $100 million. A live album and video, Pulse, was released in June 1995.",

Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity and New Age noodling\". Rolling Stone's Tom Graves criticised Gilmour's performance, writing that his guitar solos had \"settled into rambling, indistinct asides that are as forgettable as they used to be indelible ... Only on 'What Do You Want from Me' does Gilmour sound like he cares\". Robert Christgau of The Village Voice dismissed The Division Bell as a \"dud.\"\nAmong British reviewers, David Bennun of Melody Maker praised the opening instrumental \"Cluster One\" as \"magnificent\" and \"a track to rank with the most fragrant of modern ambient\", but found the rest of the album dreary, despite finding \"hints\" throughout that Gilmour understood the band's strengths. In his review for NME, Tommy Udo similarly praised \"Cluster One\" for sounding \"effortless\", despite finding its ambient nature dated and unconnected to \"ambient upstarts\" the Orb. However, while Udo enjoyed The Division Bell's lengthy instrumentals, he criticised the record overall for its \"sixth-form\" lyrics and for being \"so damned anonymous.\"\nThe album won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance on \"Marooned\". The Division Bell was nominated for the 1995 Brit Award for Best Album by a British Artist, but lost to Blur's Parklife.\nIn 2011, The Division Bell was ranked at number 93 in Q's readers poll of the \"250 Best Albums of the Last 25 Years\"; the magazine wrote that the record \"reconfigured the magisterial prog-rock of the mid-'70s for the late-20th century\" and made for a welcome \"lap of honour\". In Uncut's 2011 Pink Floyd: The Ultimate Music Guide, Graeme Thomson wrote that The Division Bell  \"might just be the dark horse of the Floyd canon. The opening triptych of songs is a hugely impressive return to something very close to the eternal essence of Pink Floyd, and much of the rest retains a quiet power and a meditative quality that betrays a genuine sense of unity.\"  In 2014, Uncut reviewed the album again for its 20th-anniversary reissue, and praised its production, writing that it sounded much \"more like a classic Pink Floyd album\" than The Final Cut (1983) and that the connection between Wright and Gilmour was \"the album's musical heart\". Waters, who left Pink Floyd in 1985, dismissed The Division Bell as \"just rubbish ... nonsense from beginning to end.\"",

The Division Bell was recorded in 1993 and 1994 in Britannia Row Studios in London, and on the Astoria boat studio, belonging to guitarist David Gilmour. Pink Floyd recorded hours of music during the sessions; the engineer Andy Jackson edited it into an hour-long ambient composition tentatively titled The Big Spliff, but the band did not release it.\n\nKeyboardist Richard Wright died of cancer on 15 September 2008. In 2013, Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason decided to revisit the unused Division Bell recordings to make a new album, re–recording parts, adding new ones, and using modern studio technology. Gilmour said: \"With Rick gone, and with him the chance of ever doing it again, it feels right that these revisited and reworked tracks should be made available as part of our repertoire.\" Only a small part of The Big Spliff was used. Two tracks from The Big Spliff are included on the deluxe version of the album as bonus tracks.\nGilmour asked guitarist and producer Phil Manzanera, who co-produced his 2006 solo album On an Island, to work on the material. Manzanera, Jackson and engineer Damon Iddins spent six weeks assembling four 14-minute pieces. Gilmour gave two pieces to producer Youth, who added guitar and bass parts. In November 2013, Gilmour led sessions with Manzanera, Youth and Jackson to record material with Mason, saxophonist Gilad Atzmon and bassist Guy Pratt. Vocalists including Durga McBroom recorded backing vocals, and Gilmour recorded lead vocals on \"Louder than Words\", with lyrics by his wife, author Polly Samson. Bassist and songwriter Roger Waters, who left Pink Floyd in 1985, was not involved.\n\"Autumn '68\", named in reference to the 1970 Pink Floyd song \"Summer '68\", features a recording of Wright playing the Royal Albert Hall pipe organ during the rehearsal for Pink Floyd's show at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 June 1969. \"Talkin' Hawkin'\" contains a sample of scientist Stephen Hawking's speech taken from a British Telecom commercial, which was also sampled for The Division Bell on \"Keep Talking\". Mason received writing credits for \"Sum\", and \"Skins\", a two-and-a-half-minute drum solo. \nGilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: \"I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end.\" Mason said it would likely be the last Pink Floyd album. In 2024, Gilmour said that The Endless River was not originally intended as \"a properly paid-for Pink Floyd record\" and that he had been \"bullied by the record company\".",

Gilmour said: \"Unapologetically, this is for the generation that wants to put its headphones on, lie in a beanbag, or whatever, and get off on a piece of music for an extended period of time. You could say it's not for the iTunes, downloading-individual-tracks generation.\" Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: \"I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was.\"\n\"Louder than Words\" is the only track with a lead vocal. Samson wrote the lyrics after observing the band's interaction during the rehearsals for their 2005 Live 8 reunion, their first performance with Waters in over 24 years. She said: \"What struck me was, they never spoke ... It’s not hostile, they just don’t speak. And then they step onto a stage and musically that communication is extraordinary.\" The album title is taken from a lyric on the last track of The Division Bell, \"High Hopes\": \"The water flowing / The endless river / For ever and ever.\" Gilmour said it suggested a continuum between the records.",

After the death of longtime Pink Floyd artist Storm Thorgerson in 2013, Pink Floyd collaborated with Aubrey Powell, co-founder of Thorgerson's design company Hipgnosis. Powell discovered 18-year-old Egyptian artist Ahmed Emad Eldin and asked to use the concept from his piece Beyond the Sky for The Endless River.  Eldin was a Pink Floyd fan and accepted enthusiastically. Powell felt Ahmed's concept had \"an instant Floydian resonance\", and described it as \"enigmatic and open to interpretation\". The final cover is a recreation of Eldin's work by London design firm Stylorouge.  Powell felt that the cover summed up the title and music, and was appropriate for the recording on the Thames.\nThe Endless River was also released in boxed DVD and Blu-ray \"deluxe\" editions, containing a 24-page hardback book, postcards, and a bonus disc of three additional tracks and six music videos. The DVD edition includes the album in Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround sound, plus a 48 kHz /24 bit stereo version.

Pink Floyd, along with many other bands under the EMI roster, were transferred to different labels during the process. The Parlophone Label Group was formed under Parlophone as one of many assets to be sold off by Universal following the acquisition of EMI, with Pink Floyd transferred to the Parlophone Label Group during the sale. The Warner Music Group, in 2013, struck a deal with Universal to buy the Parlophone Label Group from EMI, acquiring publishing rights to Pink Floyd's back catalog and future releases in the process.\nIn a tweet on 5 July 2014, Samson released the album title and a projected release window of October 2014 to pre-empt a tabloid newspaper report. The announcement was followed by backing vocalist Durga McBroom posting a photo of her alongside Gilmour in the recording studio. Details about The Endless River were announced on Pink Floyd's website on 7 July.\nPink Floyd and Parlophone unveiled The Endless River on 22 September 2014, including the release date, artwork and track listing, accompanied by a promotional website, a hyperstitial for the Pink Floyd website. The site featured an artist's statement, photographs from the Division Bell sessions, pre-order details and two teasers, one featuring a 30-second snippet of \"It's What We Do\", and a television advertisement, featuring the album's geometric-based artwork. Pre-orders on physical and digital formats started the same day.

Gilmour and Mason appeared in an interview for BBC Radio 6 Music to promote the album and to discuss Wright's contributions. The track \"Allons-y (1)\" was made available to download from the iTunes Store on 4 November 2014. In the week before release, The Endless River became the most pre-ordered album in Amazon UK's history; the following week, the record was broken by III by Take That.

Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times praised the nostalgic \"Floydian\" sound, reminiscent of Pink Floyd's work prior to The Wall (1979), and wrote: \"How fitting that a band so accustomed to loss should close their account with an engrossing elegy to their own past.\" Cameron Cooper of The Music gave the album three and a half out of five, writing that it felt \"less like a swansong and more like a final homage ... the lack of vocals gives the music more freedom, allowing it to speak for itself\". In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis described it as \"not a new album from an extant band, but an echo from the past – or a last, warm but slightly awkward group hug ... on those terms, it works just fine\". He praised the lead single and final track \"Louder than Words\" as \"stately, poignant and open-hearted\". In Rolling Stone, David Fricke wrote:\"Wright was the steady, binding majesty in the Floyd's explorations. This album is an unexpected, welcome epitaph.\" The Observer wrote that the album is \"an understated affair but unmistakably the Floyd ... a pretty good way to call it a day.\"\nJ.C. Maçek III of PopMatters wrote: \"Without the vocals, something is very clearly missing and the listener is left wanting more. While this makes for a good album, The Endless River is not quite fitting to serve as the final album of the greatest rock band of their kind, to say nothing of one of the greatest rock bands of any kind ever to perform.\" Andy Gill of The Independent called it \"just aimless jamming, one long thread of Dave Gilmour's guitar against Rick Wright's pastel keyboards and Nick Mason's tentative percussion, with nary a melody of any distinction alighted upon for the duration .... without the sparking creativity of a Syd or Roger, all that's left is ghastly faux-psychedelic dinner-party muzak.\" The NME wrote that The Endless River was \"a collection of spruced-up outtakes ... On those limited terms it works well enough, and it's interesting from a certain geeky perspective, but it's never quite as satisfying or substantial as you want it to be.\" Pitchfork wrote that The Endless River \"is quintessentially and self-consciously Pink Floyd, for better or for worse ... it proves to be one of the few Pink Floyd releases that sounds like a step backwards, with nothing new to say and no new frontiers to explore.\" Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times called it \"so excruciatingly dull (even by Pink Floyd's often-dull standards) that the band's name on the cover feels like a straight-up bait-and-switch\".",

        "summary": "The Final Cut is the twelfth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 March 1983 through Harvest and Columbia Records. It includes unused material from the band's previous studio album, The Wall (1979), and new material recorded throughout 1982.\nThe Final Cut is the last Pink Floyd album to feature founding member Roger Waters, who left the band in 1985. It is the only Pink Floyd album without founding member and keyboardist Richard Wright, who had left the band under pressure from Waters after the Wall sessions. The recording was plagued by conflict; guitarist David Gilmour felt many of the tracks were not worthy of inclusion, but Waters accused him of failing to contribute material himself. The contributions from drummer Nick Mason were limited mostly to sound effects.\nWaters planned the album as a soundtrack for The Wall's 1982 film adaptation. With the onset of the Falklands War, he rewrote it as a concept album exploring what he considered the betrayal of those — including his father — who died defending freedom in the Second World War. Waters sang lead vocals on all but one track, and he is credited for all songwriting. The album was accompanied by a short film released in the same year.\nThe Final Cut received mixed reviews, though retrospective reception has been more favourable. Though it reached number one in the UK and number six in the US, it was the lowest-selling Pink Floyd studio album worldwide since their sixth album, Meddle (1971).",

                "content": "The Final Cut was conceived as a soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall, the 1982 film based on Pink Floyd's previous studio album The Wall (1979). Under its working title Spare Bricks, it would have featured new music rerecorded for the film, such as \"When the Tigers Broke Free\". Primary songwriter Roger Waters also planned to record a small amount of new material, expanding The Wall's narrative.\n\nAs a result of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and wrote new material. He saw British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's response to Argentina's invasion of the islands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the new album—provisionally titled Requiem for a Post-War Dream—to his father, Eric Fletcher Waters. A second lieutenant of the 8th Royal Fusiliers, Eric Waters died during the Second World War at Aprilia in Italy, on 18 February 1944, when Roger was five months old. Waters said:The Final Cut was about how, with the introduction of the Welfare State, we felt we were moving forward into something resembling a liberal country where we would all look after one another ... but I'd seen all that chiselled away, and I'd seen a return to an almost Dickensian society under Margaret Thatcher. I felt then, as now, that the British government should have pursued diplomatic avenues, rather than steaming in the moment that task force arrived in the South Atlantic.\nWaters had conflicting feelings about how his generation was tackling issues that greatly affected his father's generation. In an interview in 1987, he confessed: It says something about a sense, I suppose for me personally, a sense that I may have betrayed him. He died in the last war and I kind of feel that I personally may have betrayed him, because we haven't managed to improve things very much. That the economic cycles still over-ride everything, with the best intentions, the cycle of economic recession followed by resurgence still governs our actions. Guitarist David Gilmour disliked Waters' politicising, and the new creative direction prompted arguments. Five other tracks not used on The Wall (\"Your Possible Pasts\", \"One of the Few\", \"The Final Cut\", \"The Fletcher Memorial Home\", and \"The Hero's Return\") had been set aside for Spare Bricks, and although Pink Floyd had often reused material, Gilmour felt the songs were not good enough for a new studio album. He wanted to write new material, but Waters remained doubtful as Gilmour had lately contributed little new music. Gilmour said:\nI'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy, and moments have arrived when Roger might say, \"Well, what have you got?\"  And I'd be like, \"Well, I haven't got anything right now. I need a bit of time to put some ideas on tape.\"  There are elements of all this stuff that, years later, you can look back on and say, \"Well, he had a point there.\"  But he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut. I said to Roger, \"If these songs weren't good enough for The Wall, why are they good enough now?\"\nThe title The Final Cut is a reference to William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar (1599): \"This was the most unkindest cut of all\". \"When the Tigers Broke Free\" was issued as a single titled \"Pink Floyd: The Wall: Music from the Film\" on 26 July 1982, with the film version of \"Bring the Boys Back Home\" on the B-side; the single was labelled \"Taken from the album The Final Cut\" but was not included on that album until the 2004 CD reissue.",

                "content": "The Final Cut is an anti-war concept album that explores what Waters regards as the betrayal of fallen British servicemen—such as his father—who during the Second World War sacrificed their lives in the spirit of a post-war dream. This dream was that their victory would usher in a more peaceful world, whose leaders would no longer be so eager to resolve disputes by resorting to war. The lyrics are critical of Thatcher, whose policies and decisions Waters regarded as an example of this betrayal. She is referred to as \"Maggie\" throughout most of the album, though on \"The Fletcher Memorial Home\" as \"Mrs. Thatcher\".\nThe opening track, \"The Post War Dream\", begins with a recorded announcement that the replacement for the Atlantic Conveyor, a ship lost during the Falklands campaign, will be built in Japan. Waters' lyrics refer to his dead father, the loss of Britain's shipbuilding industry to Japan, and Margaret Thatcher, before moving on to \"Your Possible Pasts\", a rewritten version of a song rejected for The Wall. In \"One of the Few\", another rejected song, the schoolteacher from The Wall features as the main character of the Final Cut short film, presented as a war hero returned to civilian life. He is unable to relate his experiences to his wife, and in \"The Hero's Return\" is tormented by the loss of one of his aircrew. \"The Gunner's Dream\" discusses the hope of a world free from tyranny and the threat of terrorism (with a reference to the Hyde Park bombing). It is followed in \"Paranoid Eyes\" by the teacher's descent into alcoholism.\nThe second half deals with various war issues. While \"Southampton Dock\" is a lament to returning war heroes and those who did not return, \"Not Now John\" addresses society's ignorance of political and economic problems. \"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\" deals with Waters' feelings about war and invasion, and \"The Fletcher Memorial Home\" (the title is a nod to Waters' father) reflects a fantastical application of \"the Final Solution\" on a gathering of political leaders including Soviet Leonid Brezhnev (who died before the album was released), Israeli Menachem Begin and Thatcher. \"The Final Cut\" deals with the aftermath of a man's social isolation and sexual repression, as he contemplates suicide and struggles to reconnect with the world around him. The album ends with \"Two Suns in the Sunset\", which portrays a nuclear holocaust: the final result of a world obsessed with war and control.",

                "content": "American composer, arranger, conductor, and musician Michael Kamen, who had contributed to The Wall, co-produced, oversaw the orchestral arrangements, and mediated between Waters and Gilmour. Along with Andy Bown, Kamen also stood in for keyboardist Richard Wright, who had left the band under pressure from Waters during the recording of The Wall. James Guthrie was the audio engineer and co-producer, while Mason's drumming was supplemented by Ray Cooper on percussion; when Mason was unable to perform the complex time changes on \"Two Suns in the Sunset\", he was replaced by session musician Andy Newmark. Mason also suggested the repeated reprises of \"Maggie, what have we done\" be rendered instrumental rather than sung. Raphael Ravenscroft was hired to play the saxophone, which was used in place of guitar solos on two tracks. Recording took place in the latter half of 1982 across eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at Hook End Manor in Oxfordshire, and Waters' Billiard Room Studios in East Sheen. The other studios were Mayfair Studios, Olympic Studios, Abbey Road Studios, Eel Pie Studios, Audio International and RAK Studios.\nTensions soon emerged, and while Waters and Gilmour initially worked together, playing the video game Donkey Kong (1981) in their spare time, they eventually chose to work separately. Audio engineer Andy Jackson worked with Waters on vocals; Guthrie with Gilmour on guitars. They would occasionally meet to discuss the work that had been completed; while this method was not in itself unusual, Gilmour began to feel strained, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. Kamen too felt pressured; Waters had never been a confident vocalist and, on one occasion, after repeated studio takes, Waters noticed him writing on a notepad. Losing his temper, he demanded to know what Kamen was doing, only to find that Kamen had been writing, \"I Must Not Fuck Sheep\" repeatedly. Waters said that \"a lot of that aggravation came through in the vocal performance, which, looking back, really was quite tortured.\"\nLike previous Pink Floyd albums, The Final Cut used sound effects combined with advances in audio recording technology. Mason's contributions were mostly limited to recording sound effects for the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to add an enhanced three-dimensional effect to the recordings; The Final Cut is the second album ever to feature this technology. The technique is featured on \"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\", creating a sound of a rocket flying by and exploding which surrounds the listener, especially when headphones are used. Sound effects are reused from the Pink Floyd albums Meddle (1971), The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979).\nAfter months of poor relations, and following a final confrontation, Gilmour had his name removed from the credit list as producer, although he was still paid production royalties. Waters later said that he was also under significant pressure and that early in production believed he would never record with Gilmour or Mason again. He may have threatened to release the album as a solo record, although Pink Floyd were contracted to EMI and such a move would have been unlikely to succeed. Mason kept himself distant, dealing with marital problems. In an August 1987 interview, Waters recalled The Final Cut as an \"absolute misery to make\", and that the band members were \"fighting like cats and dogs\". He said the experience forced them to accept that they had not worked together as a band since their ninth studio album Wish You Were Here (1975).",

From left to right, the medals are the 1939–1945 Star, the Africa Star, the Defence Medal, and the Distinguished Flying Cross.\nThe poppy is a recurring design theme. The interior gatefold features three photographs, the first depicting an outdoor scene with an outstretched hand holding three poppies and in the distance, a soldier with his back to the camera. Two more photographs show a welder at work, his mask emblazoned with the Japanese Rising Sun Flag, and a nuclear explosion (a clear reference to \"Two Suns in the Sunset\"). The lyrics are printed on the gatefold. Side one of the vinyl disc carries an image of a poppy field, and on side two, a soldier with a knife in his back lies face down amongst the poppies, a dog beside him. \nThe back cover features a photograph of an officer standing upright and holding a film canister, with a knife protruding from his back: the film canister and knife may reflect Waters' tumultuous relationship with The Wall film director Alan Parker.",

It was less successful in the United States, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200. Issued as a single, \"Not Now John\" reached the UK Top 30, with its chorus of \"Fuck all that\" bowdlerised to \"Stuff all that\".\nWith over 1,000,000 units shipped in the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified The Final Cut Platinum in May 1983. It was given double Platinum certification in 1997. However, The Final Cut was the lowest-selling Pink Floyd studio album in the United States and worldwide since Meddle. Gilmour claimed that this relative commercial failure supported his assertion that much of the material was weak. Waters responded that it was \"ridiculous\" to judge a record by its sales, and that he had been approached by a woman in a shop whose father had also been killed in the Second World War and told him The Final Cut was \"the most moving record she had ever heard\". In 1983, Gilmour said The Final Cut was \"very good but it's not personally how I would see a Pink Floyd record going\".\nThe Final Cut was released on CD in 1983. A remastered and repackaged CD was issued by EMI in Europe and on Capitol Records in the US in 2004; this included an extra song, the previously released \"When the Tigers Broke Free\". In 2007, a remastered version was released as part of the Oh, by the Way box set, packaged in a miniature replica of the original gatefold LP sleeve.",

Waters stopped with The Wall, and The Final Cut isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them.\" Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice: \"It's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it\", and awarded the album a \"C+\" grade.\nMore impressed, Rolling Stone's Kurt Loder viewed it as \"essentially a Roger Waters solo album ... a superlative achievement on several levels\". Dan Hedges of Record also approved, writing: \"On paper it sounds hackneyed and contrived – the sort of thing that was worked into the ground by everyone from P. F. Sloan to Paul Kantner. In Pink Floyd's case, it still works, partially through the understatement and ingenuity of the music and the special effects ... but mostly through the care Waters has taken in plotting out the imagery of his bleak visions.\"",

                "content": "With no plans to tour in support of the album, Waters and Gilmour turned to solo projects. Gilmour recorded and toured his second solo studio album About Face in 1984, using it to express his feelings on a range of topics from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters, who also released and began to tour in support of his debut solo studio album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, the same year. Mason released his second solo studio album, Profiles, in August 1985.\nIn 1985, faced with a potentially ruinous lawsuit from his record company and band members, Waters resigned. He believed that Pink Floyd was a \"spent force\". He applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again. His lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, and Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue; he told a Sunday Times reporter that \"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him\".\nWaters wrote to EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group, asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. With a legal case pending, he dispensed with manager Steve O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. He later contributed to the soundtrack for the adult animated disaster film When the Wind Blows (1986) and recorded a second solo studio album, Radio K.A.O.S. (1987)\nOwing to the combination of Pink Floyd's partial break-up and Waters' dominance on the project, The Final Cut is sometimes viewed as a de facto Waters solo album. The personal quality of the lyrics are related to Waters' struggle to reconcile his despair at the changing social face of Britain, and also the loss of his father during the Second World War. Gilmour's guitar solos on \"Your Possible Pasts\" and \"The Fletcher Memorial Home\" are, however, sometimes considered the equal of his best work on The Wall. More recent reviews have weighed the album's importance alongside the band's break-up. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said \"with its anger, emphasis on lyrics, and sonic textures, it's clear that it's the album that Waters intended it to be. And it's equally clear that Pink Floyd couldn't have continued in this direction.\" Stylus Magazine wrote: \"It's about pursuing something greater even when you have all the money that you could ever want. And either failing or succeeding brilliantly. It's up to you to decide whether this record is a success or a failure, but I'd go with the former every time.\" Rachel Mann of The Quietus said \"flawed though it is, The Final Cut remains a tremendous album\" and \"still has something fresh to say\". Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound was less generous: \"Rays of light are few and far between, and even on paper the track titles – including 'The Gunner's Dream' and 'Paranoid Eyes' – suggest an arduous listen.\"",

        "summary": "Meddle is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released by Harvest Records on 5 November 1971 in the United Kingdom. The album was produced between the band's touring commitments, from January to August 1971 at a series of locations around London, including EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) and Morgan Studios.\nWith no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the band devised a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album's signature track \"Echoes\". Although the band's later albums would be unified by a central theme chosen by Roger Waters, and thematically consistent lyrics written entirely by Waters, Meddle was a group effort with Waters contributing primarily to the lyrics and the bass. It is considered a transitional album between the Syd Barrett-influenced group of the 1960s and the Waters-led era of the 1970s.  \nAs with several previous albums, the cover was designed by Hipgnosis, and has been explained by its creator Storm Thorgerson – who was unhappy with the final result – to be an ear underwater. The album was well received by critics upon its release, and was commercially successful in the United Kingdom, but lacklustre publicity on the part of the band's American label Capitol Records led to poor sales in the US upon initial release.",

                "content": "Returning from a series of tours across America and England in support of Atom Heart Mother, at the start of 1971 Pink Floyd commenced work on new material at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London. At the time, EMI was equipped only with eight-track multitrack recording facilities, which the band found insufficient for the increasing technical demands of their project. They transferred their best efforts, including the opening of what became \"Echoes\", to 16-track tape at smaller studios in London (namely AIR, and Morgan in West Hampstead) and resumed work with the advantage of more flexible recording equipment. Engineers John Leckie and Peter Bown recorded the main EMI and AIR sessions, while for minor work at Morgan, Rob Black and Roger Quested handled the engineering duties.\nLacking a central theme for the project, the band used several experimental methods in an attempt to spur the creative process. One exercise involved each member playing on a separate track, with no reference to what the other members were doing. The tempo was entirely random while the band played around an agreed chord structure, and moods such as \"first two minutes romantic, next two up tempo\". Each recorded section was named, but the process was largely unproductive; after several weeks, no complete songs had been created.\nLeckie had worked on albums such as George Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Ringo Starr's Sentimental Journey both in 1970, and was employed as a tape-operator on Meddle, partly for his proclivity for working into the early hours of the morning. He has said that Pink Floyd's sessions would often begin in the afternoon, and end early the next morning, \"during which time nothing would get done. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints.\" The band would apparently spend long periods of time working on simple sounds, or a particular guitar riff. They also spent several days at AIR attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between their next albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and Wish You Were Here (1975).\nFollowing these early experiments – called Nothings – the band developed Son of Nothings, which was followed by Return of the Son of Nothings as the working title of the new album, which ultimately evolved into \"Echoes\".\nMeddle was recorded between the band's various concert commitments, and therefore its production was spread over a considerable period of time. The band recorded in the first half of April 1971, but in the latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month. In May they split their time between sessions at EMI, and rehearsals and concerts in London, Lancaster, Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Nottingham. June and July were spent mainly performing at venues across Europe. August was spent in the far east and Australia, September in Europe, and October to November in the US. In the same period, the group also produced Relics, a compilation album of some of Pink Floyd's earlier works. A mix of the album was prepared at Command Studios on 21 and 26 September. New 2016 stereo and 5.1 mixes of the album were inadvertently released as hidden tracks on the Reverber/ation Blu-ray disc in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set.",

                "content": "Although the tracks possess a variety of moods, Meddle is generally considered more cohesive than its 1970 predecessor, Atom Heart Mother. The largely instrumental \"One of These Days\" is followed by \"A Pillow of Winds\", which is distinguished by being one of the few quiet, acoustic love songs in the Pink Floyd catalogue. These two songs segue into each other across windy sound effects, anticipating the technique that would later be used on Wish You Were Here. The title of \"A Pillow of Winds\" was inspired by the games of Mahjong that Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and their wives Judith Trim and Lindy Rutter played while in the south of France.\n\"One of These Days\" was developed around an ostinato bassline created by David Gilmour, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec. The bassline was performed by Waters and David Gilmour using two bass guitars, one on old strings. Drummer Nick Mason's abstruse \"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces\" vocal line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice, and replayed at normal speed.\nThe song \"Fearless\" includes field recordings of Liverpool F.C. fans in the Anfield Kop singing club anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", which brings the song to an end in a heavily reverberated fade-out. \"San Tropez\", by contrast, is a jazz-inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo, written by Waters in his increasingly deployed style of breezy, off-the-cuff songwriting. The song was inspired by the band's trip to the south of France in 1970. Pink Floyd uncharacteristically displayed their sense of humour with \"Seamus\", a pseudo-blues novelty track featuring Steve Marriott's dog Seamus (whom Gilmour was dog-sitting) howling along to the music. Although \"Seamus\" often tops polls of the worst songs Pink Floyd ever created, the band would use animal sounds again on the 1977 album Animals (albeit as part of the concept of the album).\nThe final song on the album is the 23-minute \"Echoes\". First performed as \"Return of the Son of Nothing\" on 22 April 1971 in Norwich, the band spent about three months on the track in three studios (Morgan, AIR and EMI). \"Echoes\" began with a studio experiment involving Richard Wright's piano. Wright had fed a single note through a Leslie speaker, producing a submarine-like ping. The band tried repeatedly to recreate this sound in the studio but were unsuccessful, and so the demo version was used on what would later become \"Echoes\", mixed almost exclusively at AIR Studios. Combined with David Gilmour's guitar, the band were able to develop the track further, experimenting with accidental sound effects, such as Gilmour's guitar being plugged into a wah-wah pedal back to front (connecting the guitar to the pedal's output and the pedal's input to the amplifier), an effect they used live from 1970 for the central section of “Embryo”. Unlike with Atom Heart Mother, the new multi-track capabilities of the studio enabled them to create the track in stages, rather than performing it in a single take. The final, 23-minute piece would eventually take up the entire second side of the album.\n\"Echoes\" also gave its name to the 2001 compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, on which a much-edited version of the title track was included. On the compilation, multiple edits throughout the entire song cut the running length of the piece down by some seven minutes. Some of the material composed during the creation of Meddle was not used; however, one song would eventually become \"Brain Damage\", on The Dark Side of the Moon.",

The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water).\nThorgerson later expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: \"I think Meddle is a much better album than its cover\". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shared his sentiments, saying: \"Meddle was a mess. I hated that cover. I don't think we did them justice with that at all; it's half-hearted.\" The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band, which would be their last until 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason.",

Rolling Stone's Jean-Charles Costa wrote: \"Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again\", and the NME called it \"an exceptionally good album\". Steve Peterson of Hit Parader cited \"Fearless\" as its best song and said of the album, \"This has got to be their best ever.\" Ed Kelleher of Circus called it \"another masterpiece by a masterful group\", noting \"Fearless\" as \"fascinating\" and praising \"Echoes\" as \"a tone poem that allows all four band members much time to stretch their muscles\". However, Melody Maker was more reserved, describing the album as \"a soundtrack to a non-existent movie\".\nIn Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said Meddle was a fairly good progression over the group's previous work and featured folk songs highlighted by unique melodies, although he lamented the lyrics to \"A Pillow of Winds\": \"The word 'behold' should never cross their filters again\". In his critique of \"Echoes\", he believed the vocal melody imitates \"Across the Universe\" by the Beatles but over 23 minutes of music that flows with a \"timeless calm\" similar to \"Interstellar Overdrive\". Daryl Easlea of the BBC felt it was a similar, but more consistent and tuneful version of Atom Heart Mother, highlighted by \"Echoes\", which he said \"dominates the entire work\" and is \"everything right about progressive rock; engaging, intelligent and compelling\". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield said \"Echoes\" showed Pink Floyd to be a more developed group than before, \"coloring the slow guitar ripples with deep-in-the-studio sonic details that only the truly baked would notice, much less appreciate.\" Writing for AllMusic, editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Meddle the best album from their transitional years leading up to The Dark Side of the Moon, as it \"spends most of its time with sonic textures and elongated compositions, most notably on its epic closer, 'Echoes'\". He noted a \"uniform tone\", but not song structure, and wrote of the album's significance in the band's catalogue: \"Pink Floyd were nothing if not masters of texture, and Meddle is one of their greatest excursions into little details, pointing the way to the measured brilliance of [The] Dark Side of the Moon and the entire Roger Waters era.\"\nThe album was voted number 255 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000).",

        "summary": "A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released in the UK on 7 September 1987 by EMI and the following day in the US by Columbia Records. It was recorded primarily on the converted houseboat Astoria, belonging to the guitarist, David Gilmour.\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason was the first Pink Floyd album recorded without founding member Roger Waters, who departed in 1985. The production was marred by legal fights with Waters over the rights to the Pink Floyd name, which were not resolved until several months after release. It also saw the return of Richard Wright, the group's keyboardist who had been fired by Waters during the recording of The Wall (1979). Wright returned as a session player.\nUnlike most of Pink Floyd's studio records from the preceding decade, A Momentary Lapse of Reason is not a concept album. It includes writing contributions from outside songwriters, following Gilmour's decision to include material once intended for his third solo album. The album was promoted with three singles: the double A-side \"Learning to Fly\" / \"Terminal Frost\", \"On the Turning Away\", and \"One Slip\".\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason received mixed reviews. Critics praised the production and instrumentation, but criticised the songwriting, especially the lyrics, and it was derided by Waters. It reached number three in the UK and US, and outsold Pink Floyd's previous album, The Final Cut (1983). It was supported by a successful world tour between 1987 and 1989, including a free performance on a barge on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.",

                "content": "After the release of Pink Floyd's 1983 studio album The Final Cut, viewed by some as a de facto solo record by bassist and songwriter Roger Waters, the band members worked on solo projects. Guitarist David Gilmour expressed feelings about his strained relationship with Waters on his second solo studio album, About Face (1984), and finished the accompanying tour as Waters began touring to promote his debut solo studio album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both had enlisted a range of successful performers, including in Waters' case Eric Clapton, their solo acts attracted fewer fans than Pink Floyd; poor ticket sales forced Gilmour to cancel several concerts, and critic David Fricke felt that Waters' show was \"a petulant echo, a transparent attempt to prove that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd\". Waters returned to the US in March 1985 with a second tour, this time without the support of CBS Records, which had expressed its preference for a new Pink Floyd album; Waters criticised the corporation as \"a machine\".\n\nAfter drummer Nick Mason attended one of Waters' London performances in 1985, he found he missed touring under the Pink Floyd name. His visit coincided with the release in August of his second solo album, Profiles, on which Gilmour sang. With a shared love of aviation, Mason and Gilmour were taking flying lessons and together bought a de Havilland Dove aeroplane. Gilmour was working on other collaborations, including a performance for Bryan Ferry at 1985's Live Aid concert, and co-produced the Dream Academy's self-titled debut album.\nIn December 1985, Waters announced that he had left Pink Floyd, which he believed was \"a spent force creatively\". After the failure of his About Face tour, Gilmour hoped to continue with the Pink Floyd name. The threat of a lawsuit from Gilmour, Mason and CBS Records was meant to compel Waters to write and produce another Pink Floyd album with his bandmates, who had barely participated in making The Final Cut; Gilmour was especially critical of the album, labelling it \"cheap filler\" and \"meandering rubbish\".\n\nAccording to Gilmour, \"I told [Waters] before he left, 'If you go, man, we're carrying on. Make no bones about it, we would carry on', and Roger replied: 'You'll never fucking do it.'\" Waters had written to EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. He also dispensed with the services of Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. This left Gilmour and Mason, in their view, free to continue with the Pink Floyd name. In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had not understood English jurisprudence.\nIn Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hook End studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \"Learning to Fly\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \"mucking about with a lot of demos\".\nAt this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\". By the end of that year, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, and agreed to rework the material that Ralbovsky had found objectionable.",

                "content": "Gilmour experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \"Learning to Fly\" and \"On the Turning Away\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour chose a more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. Gilmour later said that the project had been difficult without Waters.\nA Momentary Lapse of Reason was recorded in several studios, mainly Gilmour's houseboat studio Astoria, moored on the Thames; according to Ezrin, \"working there was just magical, so inspirational; kids sculling down the river, geese flying by...\". Andy Jackson was brought in to engineer. During sessions held between November 1986 and February 1987, Gilmour's band worked on new material, which in a change from previous Pink Floyd albums was mostly recorded with a 32-track ProDigi digital recorder apart from the drum tracks, which were recorded with a 24-track analogue machine. This trend of using new technologies continued with the use of MIDI synchronisation, aided by an Apple Macintosh computer.\nEzrin suggested incorporating rap, an idea dismissed by Gilmour. After agreeing to rework the material that Ralbovsky had found objectionable, Gilmour employed session musicians such as Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner. Both drummers replaced Mason on several songs; Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, and instead busied himself with its sound effects. Some drum parts were also performed by drum machines. In his memoir, Mason wrote: \"In hindsight, I really should have had the self-belief to play all the drum parts. And in the early days of life after Roger, I think David and I felt that we had to get it right, or we would be slaughtered.\"\nDuring the sessions, Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd's former keyboardist, Richard Wright, if he could contribute. A founding member of the band, Wright had left in 1981, and there were legal obstacles to his return; after a meeting in Hampstead he was recruited as a paid musician on a weekly wage of $11,000. Gilmour said in an interview that Wright's presence \"would make us stronger legally and musically\". However, his contributions were minimal; most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded, and so from February 1987 Wright played some background reinforcement on a Hammond organ, and a Rhodes piano, and added vocal harmonies. He also performed a solo in \"On the Turning Away\", which was discarded, according to Wright, \"not because they didn't like it ... they just thought it didn't fit\".\nGilmour later said: \"Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning. Neither of them played on this at all really. In my view, they'd been destroyed by Roger.\" Gilmour's comments angered Mason, who said: \"I'd deny that I was catatonic. I'd expect that from the opposition, it's less attractive from one's allies. At some point, he made some sort of apology.\" Mason conceded that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived.\n\n\"Learning to Fly\" was inspired by Gilmour's flying lessons, which occasionally conflicted with his studio duties. The track also contains a recording of Mason's voice during takeoff. The band experimented with samples, and Ezrin recorded the sound of Gilmour's boatman Langley Iddens rowing across the Thames. Iddens' presence at the sessions became vital when Astoria began to lift in response to the rapidly rising river, which was pushing the boat against the pier on which it was moored.\n\"The Dogs of War\" is a song about \"physical and political mercenaries\", according to Gilmour. It came about through a mishap in the studio when a sampling machine began playing a sample of laughter, which Gilmour thought sounded like a dog's bark. \"Terminal Frost\" was one of Gilmour's older demos, which he decided to leave as an instrumental. Conversely, the lyrics for \"Sorrow\" were written before the music. The song's opening guitar solo was recorded in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. A 24-track mobile studio piped Gilmour's guitar tracks through a public address system, and the resulting mix was then recorded in surround sound.",

                        "content": "The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \"the new Pink Floyd project\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him; no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\"\nWaters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin, who later suggested that he was being \"checked out\". As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd Music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A&M Studios in Los Angeles: \"It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night.\" The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year. The legal disputes were resolved out of court by the end of 1987.",

The final title appears as a line in the chorus of \"One Slip\".\nFor the first time since 1977's Animals, designer Storm Thorgerson was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio album cover. His finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach, inspired by a phrase from \"Yet Another Movie\" and Gilmour's vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house, as well as \"vestiges of relationships that have evaporated, leaving only echoes\". The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds assembled in July 1987 on Saunton Sands in North Devon, where some of the scenes for Pink Floyd – The Wall were filmed. The beds were arranged by Thorgerson's colleague Colin Elgie. An ultralight in the sky references \"Learning to Fly\". The photographer, Robert Dowling, won a gold award at the Association of Photographers Awards for the image, which took about two weeks to create. Some versions of the cover do not feature the ultralight, and other versions feature a nurse making one of the beds.\nTo emphasise that Waters had left the band, the inner gatefold featured a photograph of just Gilmour and Mason shot by David Bailey. Its inclusion marked the first time since Meddle (1971) that a group photo had been used in the packaging of a Pink Floyd album. Wright was represented only by name, on the credits. According to Mason, Wright's leaving agreement contained a clause that prevented him rejoining the band, and \"consequently we had to be careful about what constituted being a member\". In later reissues of the album, Wright's image was added to the band portrait.",

It went straight to number three in both countries, held from the top spot in the US by Michael Jackson's Bad and Whitesnake's self-titled album. It spent 34 weeks on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified silver and gold in the UK on 1 October 1987, and gold and platinum in the US on 9 November. It went double platinum on 18 January the following year, triple platinum on 10 March 1992, and quadruple platinum on 16 August 2001, greatly outselling The Final Cut.\nGilmour presented A Momentary Lapse as a return to an older Pink Floyd sound, citing his belief that under Waters' tenure, lyrics had become more important than music. He said that their albums The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were successful \"not just because of Roger's contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics [than on later albums]\". Waters said of A Momentary Lapse: \"I think it's very facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general; the lyrics I can't quite believe. Gilmour's lyrics are very third-rate.\" Wright said Waters' criticisms were \"fair\". In a later interview, Waters said the album had \"a couple of really nice tunes\" and chord sequences and melodies he would have retained had he been involved.\nIn Q, Phil Sutcliffe wrote that it \"does sound like a Pink Floyd album\" and highlighted the two-part \"A New Machine\" as \"a chillingly beautiful vocal exploration\" and a \"brilliant stroke of imagination\". He concluded: \"A Momentary Lapse is Gilmour's album to much the same degree that the previous four under Floyd's name were dominated by Waters ... Clearly it wasn't only business sense and repressed ego but repressed talent which drove the guitarist to insist on continuing under the band brand-name.\" Recognising the return to a more music-oriented approach, Sounds said the album was \"back over the wall to where diamonds are crazy, moons have dark sides, and mothers have atom hearts\".\nConversely, Greg Quill of the Toronto Star wrote: \"Something's missing here. This is, for all its lumbering weight, not a record that challenges and provokes as Pink Floyd should. A Momentary Lapse of Reason, sorry to say, is mundane, predictable.\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote: \"You'd hardly know the group's conceptmaster was gone – except that they put out noticeably fewer ideas.\" In 2016, AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann described it as a \"Gilmour solo album in all but name\".\nIn 2016, Nick Shilton chose A Momentary Lapse of Reason as one of the \"Top 10 Essential 80s Prog Albums\" for Prog. He wrote: \"While it's not a patch on the Floyd masterworks of the 70s, it merits inclusion here. The ironically titled 'Signs of Life' is an instrumental prelude for 'Learning to Fly' which showcases Gilmour's guitar, while the pulsating 'The Dogs of War' is considerably darker, and the uplifting 'On the Turning Away' simply sublime.\"",

Rolling Stone described this version as \"more tasteful ... [It] doesn't drown in eighties reverb the way the original did ... Although none of the Momentary Lapse remixes will be dramatic enough to sway the band's critics, they add clarity to what Gilmour was trying to achieve.\"",

Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were out of practice, and, realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to take charge. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs; Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters and threatened to sue if they used the Pink Floyd name. Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.\nAs the new line-up (with Wright) toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was sometimes close by. Waters forbade the members of Pink Floyd to attend his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues. Waters also issued a writ for copyright fees for use of the Pink Floyd flying pig; Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters had given up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was reached at a meeting on Astoria.\nThe Momentary Lapse tour beat box office records in every US venue it booked, and was the most successful US tour that year. Tours of Australia, Japan, and Europe followed, before two more tours of the US. Almost every venue was sold out. A live album, Delicate Sound of Thunder, was released on 22 November 1988, followed in June 1989 by a concert video. A few days later, the live album was played in orbit, on board Soyuz TM-7. The tour eventually came to an end by closing the Silver Clef Award Winners Concert, at Knebworth Park on 30 June 1990, after 200 performances, a gross audience of 4.25 million fans, and box office receipts of more than £60 million (not including merchandising).

Instead of typical background music, Schroeder wanted the songs to feature in the film, such as a record playing at a party. The group also speculated they could branch out into a career as film composers if their recording and touring career did not work out. Drummer Nick Mason later said the film was \"ideally suited to some of the rumblings, squeaks and sound textures we produced on a regular basis\".\nThe album was recorded at Pye Studios in London, in late January and early February 1969 with engineer Brian Humphries. The album was the first to be produced by Pink Floyd without assistance from Norman Smith, who retained an executive producer credit, and the first full album without Syd Barrett, who had left the group in 1968, during the recording of their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets.\nPink Floyd worked out most of the music in two weeks, with material put together quickly and semi-improvised. They did not use a dubbing studio due to budget constraints, and simply timed sequences in the film with a stopwatch so they knew how long the music had to be. Bassist Roger Waters wrote most of the lyrics during breaks between recording backing tracks. Schroeder was impressed by how quickly the group created and recorded the material. Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright co-wrote the instrumental \"Up The Khyber\", the only time the pair were credited as sole co-composers. Barrett's replacement, David Gilmour, handled all lead vocals on the album.",

                "content": "More features a mixture of styles. Songs such as \"Green is the Colour\" were acoustic folk ballads, a genre not often explored by the group. Mason's wife Lindy played penny whistle on the track. The album also contains hard rock, such as \"The Nile Song\" and \"Ibiza Bar\", as well as several instrumental tracks such as \"Quicksilver\" and \"Main Theme\", featuring their experimental and avant-garde approach. \"Cymbaline\" criticised the music industry, with lines such as \"your manager and agent are both busy on the phone\". The version on the album is different from that in the film. Gilmour sings lead on both versions, though Waters is sometimes wrongly credited as singing lead for the film version.  The album also contains elements of electronic and mood music.\n\"Green is the Colour\" was played live frequently after release, as a medley with \"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\", as part of a live suite called \"The Journey\". It was a regular feature in the set for two years afterwards. \"Quicksilver\" was played under the title \"Sleeping\" as part of the 1969 live show called \"The Man\", while \"Cymbaline\" was entitled \"Nightmare\". The latter remained part of the group's repertoire until the end of 1971. In live performances, the group left the stage partway through the song while the audience listened to a tape of quadraphonic sound effects including footsteps travelling round the venue, and doors opening. \"Main Theme\" was briefly played live in 1970.\nTwo songs can be heard in the film which were not included on the album: \"Hollywood\" and \"Seabirds\". The latter was published in 1976's The Pink Floyd Songbook. Both songs, as well as two other songs from those sessions, \"Theme (Beat Version)\" and \"More Blues (Alternative Version)\", were released on the 2016 box set, The Early Years 1965–1972. The set in which these tracks appear, 1969: Dramatis/ation was made available as a standalone release in 2017. The track called \"Seabirds\" in the box set is not the original song, but an alternative take of \"Quicksilver\".\nTracks like \"The Crying Song\" and \"Cymbaline\" play on female lead Mimsy Farmer's transistor radio as she's in her apartment room, and \"Ibiza Bar\" (as the title implies) plays in the background in a bar. These differ from tracks such as \"Up The Khyber\" that plays to the action of the film, in which the band are actual composers, or tracks such as \"Cirrus Minor\" and \"Green is the Colour\" that play to orchestrate the mood of the scene, and these tracks (and others), unlike \"The Crying Song\" and \"Cymbaline\", are not heard by any of the characters.",

It serves as the soundtrack for the French film La Vallée, by Barbet Schroeder. It was recorded in two sessions in France, while Pink Floyd were in the midst of touring, and produced by the band.\nThe album's only single was \"Free Four\". Obscured by Clouds has been seen as a stopgap for the band, who had started work on their next album, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). The album reached number six in the United Kingdom and number 46 in the United States;  retrospective opinions from both fans and critics have been mixed, some critics noting the similarities to their later material.",

On the back of More's success, its director, Barbet Schroeder, asked them to record the soundtrack to his next major project. The new film, La Vallée, would be about two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group had already started working on another album, The Dark Side of the Moon, including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, just before and after doing a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Sound Studios in London.\nAs they had done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be cross-faded at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable without the need for any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.\nDuring the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station ORTF filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with bassist Roger Waters and guitarist David Gilmour. In a snippet of interview footage at Abbey Road Studios that appeared in the 1974 theatrical version (later released on VHS and Laserdisc and subsequent \"Director's Cut\" DVD) of Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii, Waters said that early UK pressings of the album contained excessive sibilance.\nAfter recording had finished, the band fell out with the film company, prompting them to release the soundtrack album as Obscured by Clouds, rather than La Vallée. In response, the film was retitled La Vallée (Obscured by Clouds) on its release.",

                "content": "The songs on Obscured by Clouds are all short and economical, in contrast to the lengthy instrumentals found on other Floyd albums. A strong country music influence is present on several tracks, with prominent use of acoustic guitar. The album also features the VCS 3 synthesiser, which Wright had purchased from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.\nThe title track uses the VCS 3 and Mason playing electronic drums. It was written by David Gilmour and Roger Waters. The following track, \"When You're In\", is similar in style, with Gilmour coming up with the main riff and the rest of the band jamming on it. Its title came from a phrase said by roadie Chris Adamson. The two pieces were played back-to-back live in late 1972 and on the 1973 tours. They were also part of the set used for the group's collaboration with Roland Petit and the Ballet National de Marseille at the Palais de Sports, Paris, in early 1973.\n\"Burning Bridges\" is one of two songwriting collaborations on the album between keyboardist Richard Wright (who wrote the music) and Waters (who wrote the lyrics). \"The Gold It's In The ... \" is a straightforward rock song; Gilmour, who composed the music, may have played bass on the track instead of Waters (who wrote the lyrics), as well as multiple electric guitar parts. \"Wot's... Uh the Deal?\" is a straightforward acoustic piece with music by Gilmour and lyrics by Waters. It was never performed live by Pink Floyd, but Gilmour resurrected the piece for his solo tour in 2006. One of these performances features on Gilmour's 2007 DVD Remember That Night and the vinyl version of his 2008 live album, Live in Gdańsk. \"Mudmen\" is an instrumental adaptation of \"Burning Bridges\" in a different time signature, and It was composed by Wright and Gilmour.\n\"Childhood's End\" was the last song Pink Floyd released to have lyrics written by Gilmour (who also wrote the music) until the release of A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987. The title may have been derived from the Arthur C. Clarke novel of the same name. It was performed live at a few gigs in late 1972 and early the following year; the drum pattern opening the track was recycled for \"Time\" on The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\"Free Four\" was the first Pink Floyd song since \"See Emily Play\" to attract significant airplay in the US, and the second (after \"Corporal Clegg\" from A Saucerful of Secrets) to refer to the death of Waters' father during World War II. The title is derived from the count-in \"One, two, 'free, four!\", spoken in a Cockney accent. Waters played rhythm acoustic guitar during the recording, as well as bass, and its the only song to be entirely written by him on the album. The track was released as a single in the US, as the band felt it was suitable for AM radio.\n\"Stay\" was written and sung by Wright, with lyrics by Waters. It is superficially a love song, except the protagonist cannot remember the girl's name, suggesting that she might have been a groupie. \"Absolutely Curtains\", the closing instrumental on the album, even if credited to the whole band, is primarily based around Wright's keyboards (who actually composed the track). It ends with a recording of the Mapuga tribe chanting, as seen in the film.",

The still is out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it be given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.",

        "summary": "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the debut studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 4 August 1967 by EMI Columbia. It is the only Pink Floyd album recorded under the leadership of founder member Syd Barrett (lead vocals, guitar); he was the sole writer of all but three tracks, with additional writing by members Roger Waters (bass, vocals), Nick Mason (drums), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). The album followed the band's influential 1966-67 performances at London's UFO Club and their early chart success with the 1967 non-album singles \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play\".\nThe album was recorded at EMI Studios in London's Abbey Road from February to May 1967 and produced by Norman Smith. It blended Pink Floyd's reputation for long-form improvisational pieces with Barrett's short pop songs and whimsical take on psychedelia. The album made prominent use of recording effects such as reverb and echo, employing tools such as EMT plate reverberation, automatic double tracking (ADT), and Abbey Road's echo chamber. Part-way through the recording sessions, Barrett's growing use of the psychedelic drug LSD accompanied his increasingly debilitated mental state, leading to his eventual departure from the group the following year. The album title was derived from referencing the god Pan in chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's 1908 children's novel The Wind in the Willows, a favourite of Barrett's.\nThe album was released to critical and commercial success, reaching number 6 on the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, it was released as Pink Floyd in October on Tower Records with an altered track listing that omitted three songs and included \"See Emily Play\". In the UK, no singles were released from the album, but in the US, \"Flaming\" was offered as a single. Two of its songs, \"Astronomy Dominé\" and \"Interstellar Overdrive\", became long-term mainstays of the band's live setlist, while other songs were performed live only a handful of times.  In 1973, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was packaged with the band's second album A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) and released as A Nice Pair, to introduce the band's early work to new fans gained with the success of The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).\nThe album has since been hailed as a pivotal psychedelic music recording. Special limited editions of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn were issued to mark its 30th, 40th, and 50th anniversaries, with the former two releases containing bonus tracks. In 2012, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was placed at number 347 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", moved up to number 253 in the 2020 edition.",

Around 1966, the group began to achieve underground success for their influential performances at London's UFO Club. They turned professional on 1 February 1967 when they signed with EMI, with an advance fee of £5,000. Their first single, a song about a kleptomaniac transvestite titled \"Arnold Layne\", was released on 11 March to mild controversy, as Radio London refused to air it.\nAbout three weeks later, the band were introduced to the mainstream media. EMI's press release claimed that the band were \"musical spokesmen for a new movement which involves experimentation in all the arts\", but EMI attempted to put some distance between them and the underground scene from which the band originated by stating that \"the Pink Floyd does not know what people mean by psychedelic pop and are not trying to create hallucinatory effects on their audiences.\" The band returned to Sound Techniques studio to record their next single, \"See Emily Play\", on 18 May. The single was released almost a month later, on 16 June, and reached number six in the charts.\nPink Floyd picked up a tabloid reputation for making music for LSD users. The popular broadsheet News of the World printed a story nine days before the album's recording sessions began, saying that \"The Pink Floyd group specialise in 'psychedelic music', which is designed to illustrate LSD experiences.\" Contrary to this image, only Barrett was known to be taking LSD; authors Ray B. Browne and Pat Browne contend that he was the \"only real drug user in the band\".",

                "content": "Pink Floyd's record deal was a £5,000 advance over five years, low royalties and no free studio time, which was poor by today's standards, but typical for the time. It included album development, which was very unusual; EMI, unsure of exactly what kind of band they had signed, gave them free rein to record whatever they wanted.\nThey recorded the album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London and their recording room was next to the Beatles' recording room where the Beatles were recording the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Pink Floyd sat in on one Beatles session for the song \"Lovely Rita\". The Piper at the Gates of Dawn was overseen by producer Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones an hour before the sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of the quietness of Barrett's singing, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album features an unusually heavy use of echo and reverb to create a unique sound. Much of the reverb came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators – customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension – and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.\nThe album is made up of two different classes of songs: lengthy improvisations from the band's live performances and shorter songs that Barrett had written. Barrett's LSD intake escalated part-way through the album's recording sessions. Although in his 2005 autobiography Mason recalled the sessions as relatively trouble-free, Smith disagreed and claimed that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. In an attempt to build a relationship with the band, Smith played jazz on the piano while the band joined in. These jam sessions worked well with Waters, who was apparently helpful, and Wright, who was \"laid-back\". Smith's attempts to connect with Barrett were less productive: \"With Syd, I eventually realised I was wasting my time.\" Smith later admitted that his traditional ideas of music were somewhat at odds with the psychedelic background from which Pink Floyd had come. Nevertheless, he managed to \"discourage the live ramble\", as band manager Peter Jenner called it, guiding the band toward producing songs with a more manageable length.\nBarrett would end up writing eight of the album's songs and contributing to two instrumentals credited to the whole band, with Waters creating the sole remaining composition \"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\". Mason recalled how the album \"was recorded in what one might call the old-fashioned way: rather quickly. As time went by we started spending longer and longer.\"\n\nRecording started on 21 February with six takes of \"Matilda Mother\", then called \"Matilda's Mother\". The following week, on the 27th, the band recorded five takes of \"Interstellar Overdrive\", and \"Chapter 24\". On 16 March, the band had another go at recording \"Interstellar Overdrive\", in an attempt to create a shorter version, and \"Flaming\" (originally titled \"Snowing\"), which was recorded in a single take with one vocal overdub. On 19 March, six takes of \"The Gnome\" were recorded. The following day, the band recorded Waters' \"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\". On 21 March, the band were invited to watch the Beatles record \"Lovely Rita\". The following day, they recorded \"The Scarecrow\" in one take. The next three tracks – \"Astronomy Dominé\", \"Interstellar Overdrive\" and \"Pow R. Toc H.\" – were worked on extensively between 21 March and 12 April, having originally been lengthy instrumentals. Between 12 and 18 April, the band recorded \"Percy the Rat Catcher\" and a currently unreleased track called \"She Was a Millionaire\".\n\"Percy the Rat Catcher\" received overdubs across five studio sessions and then was mixed in late June, eventually being given the name \"Lucifer Sam\". Songwriting for the majority of the album is credited solely to Barrett, with tracks such as \"Bike\" having been written in late 1966 before the album was started. \"Bike\" was recorded on 21 May 1967 and originally entitled \"The Bike Song\". By June, Barrett's increasing LSD use during the recording project left him looking visibly debilitated.",

Steve Huey of AllMusic assessed that the album's tracks alternate between \"catchy, melodic acid pop songs\" and \"longer, more experimental pieces showcasing the group's instrumental freak-outs.\" He described the album's lyrical content as \"full of colorful, childlike, distinctly British whimsy, albeit filtered through the perceptive lens of LSD.\" Additionally, the album contains themes pertaining to space travel. Rick Wright's keyboard work has been described as sounding \"eerie,\" and makes use of dissonance and chromaticism. Music historian Jeff Gold suggested that the album's \"more spacey excursions like \"Astronomy Domine,\" \"Interstellar Overdrive\" and \"Lucifer Sam\" firmly captured the freak-flag of British psychedelia.\"",

The full album was released on 4 August 1967, including \"The Scarecrow\".\nPink Floyd continued to perform at the UFO Club, drawing huge crowds, but Barrett's deterioration caused them serious concern. The band initially hoped that his erratic behaviour was a phase that would pass, but others, including manager Peter Jenner and his secretary June Child, were more realistic:\n\n... I found him in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, we got him out to the stage ... and of course the audience went spare because they loved him. The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down.\nTo the band's consternation, they were forced to cancel their appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Jenner and Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist – a meeting he did not attend. He was sent to relax in the sun on the Spanish island of Formentera with Waters and Sam Hutt (a doctor well-established in the underground music scene), but this led to no visible improvement.\n\nThe original UK LP was released on 4 August 1967 in both monaural and stereophonic mixes. It reached number six on the UK charts. The original US album appeared on the Tower division of Capitol on 21 October 1967. This version was officially titled simply Pink Floyd, though the original album title did appear on the back cover as on the UK issue, and Dick Clark referred to the record by its original title when the group appeared on his American Bandstand television program on 18 November. The US album featured an abbreviated track listing, and reached number 131 on the Billboard charts. The UK single, \"See Emily Play\", was substituted for \"Astronomy Dominé\", \"Flaming\" and \"Bike\". Released in time for the band's US tour, \"Flaming\" was released as a single, backed with \"The Gnome\". The Tower issue of the album also faded out \"Interstellar Overdrive\" and broke up the segue into \"The Gnome\" to fit the re-sequencing of the songs. Later US issues on compact disc had the same title and track list as the UK version. The album was certified Gold in the US as a part of A Nice Pair with A Saucerful of Secrets on 11 March 1994.\nAbout being handled on Tower Records, Jenner commented that: \"In terms of the U.K. and Europe it was always fine. America was always difficult. Capitol couldn't see it. You know, 'What is this latest bit of rubbish from England? Oh Christ, it'll give us more grief, so we'll put it out on Tower Records', which was a subsidiary of Capitol Records [...] It was a very cheapskate operation and it was the beginning of endless problems The Floyd had with Capitol. It started off bad and went on being bad.\"",

Singh shared a studio with photographer David Bailey, and he was friends with Beatles guitarist George Harrison. Singh asked Jenner and King to dress the band in the brightest clothes they could find. Singh then shot them with a prism lens that Harrison had given him. The cover was meant to resemble an LSD trip, a style that was favoured at the time. In 2017, the lens was displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum, as part of the Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition.\nBarrett came up with the album title The Piper at the Gates of Dawn; the album was originally titled Projection up to as late as July 1967. The title was taken from that of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows which contains a visionary encounter with the god Pan, who plays his pan pipe at dawn. It was one of Barrett's favourite books, and he often gave friends the impression that he was the embodiment of Pan. The moniker was later used in the song \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", in which Barrett is called \"you Piper\". The cover was one of several Pink Floyd album covers used on a series of Royal Mail stamps issued in May 2016 to commemorate 50 years of Pink Floyd.\nIn 2018, the album was reissued in its mono mix. With this version came a new packaging box with the original record cover inside. This new design was done by Hipgnosis' Aubrey Powell and Peter Curzon and includes a gold-embossed version of the graphic by Syd Barrett which features on the back cover of the original LP.",

And I was thinking if this was to be the music of the future, I wasn't looking forward to it. But, like a lot of stuff, you get to like bits of it over a long period.\"\nIn 1999, Rolling Stone gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it \"the golden achievement of Syd Barrett\". In 2003, it was ranked number 347 on the magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", maintaining that rank in the 2012 update and climbing to number 253 in the 2020 reboot of the list. \nThe Piper at the Gates of Dawn is hailed as a psychedelic masterpiece and LSD is named as a direct influence. AllMusic called it one of the greatest psychedelic albums of all time, and described it as \"full of colorful, childlike, distinctly British whimsy, albeit filtered through the perceptive lens of LSD,\" adding that \"Barrett's catchy, melodic acid pop songs are balanced with longer, more experimental pieces showcasing the group's instrumental freak-outs.\"\nJames E. Perone says that The Piper at the Gates of Dawn became known as a concept album in later years, because listeners wanted to play it all the way through rather than pick out a favourite song. While Beatles biographer Philip Norman agrees that The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is a concept album, other authors contend that Pink Floyd did not start making concept albums until 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. Author George Reisch called Pink Floyd the \"undisputed\" kings of the concept album, but only starting from Dark Side. In July 2006, Billboard described The Piper at the Gates of Dawn as \"one of the best psychedelic rock albums ever, driven by Barrett's oddball narratives and the band's skill with both long jams and perfect pop nuggets\".\nIn the book 101 Essential Rock Records, music historian Jeff Gold suggested that Pink Floyd \"ultimately invented progressive rock in one fell swoop\" with the album.",

                "content": "The band promoted the album with a series of concerts. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, mainly because of the mental breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but he ran into serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. After a number of cancellations, the first US performance was given 4 November at Winterland Ballroom, following Janis Joplin fronting Big Brother and the Holding Company.\nCommunication between record company and band was almost non-existent, and Pink Floyd's relationship with Tower and Capitol was therefore poor. Barrett's mental condition mirrored the problems that King encountered; when the band performed at Winterland, he detuned his guitar during \"Interstellar Overdrive\" until the strings fell off. His odd behaviour grew worse in subsequent performances, and during a television recording for The Pat Boone Show he confounded the director by lip-syncing \"Apples and Oranges\" perfectly during the rehearsal, and then standing motionless during the take. King quickly curtailed the band's US visit, sending them home on the next flight.\nShortly after their return from the US, beginning 14 November, the band supported Jimi Hendrix on a tour of England, but on one occasion Barrett failed to turn up and they were forced to replace him with singer/guitarist David O'List borrowed from the opening band the Nice. Barrett's depression worsened the longer the tour continued. Longtime Pink Floyd psychedelic lighting designer Peter Wynne-Willson left at the end of the Hendrix tour, though he sympathised with Barrett, whose position as frontman was increasingly insecure. Wynne-Willson, who had worked for a percentage, was replaced by his assistant John Marsh, who collected a lesser wage. Pink Floyd released \"Apples and Oranges\" (recorded prior to the US tour on 26 and 27 October) but, for the rest of the band, Barrett's condition had reached a crisis point, and they responded by adding David Gilmour to their line-up, initially to cover for Syd's lapses during live performances.\nSome songs on the album were rarely played live. \"Flaming\" and \"Pow R. Toc H.\" were performed by Pink Floyd after Barrett's departure in 1968. After September 1967, the band played several new songs in concert. These included \"One in a Million\", \"Scream Thy Last Scream\", \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" and \"Reaction in G\", the last of which was a song created by the band in response to crowds asking for their hit singles \"See Emily Play\" and \"Arnold Layne\". Barrett resurrected the track \"Lucifer Sam\" with his short-lived 1972 band Stars. \"Astronomy Dominé\" was later on the live disc of Ummagumma (1969), and adopted by the post-Waters Pink Floyd during the 1994 Division Bell Tour, with a version included on the 1995 live album Pulse. David Gilmour, though not a member of Pink Floyd at the time the song was originally recorded, resurrected \"Astronomy Dominé\" for his On an Island and Rattle That Lock tours.",

        "summary": "A Saucerful of Secrets is the second studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 28 June 1968 by EMI Columbia in the UK and in the US by Tower Records. The mental health of the singer and guitarist Syd Barrett deteriorated during recording, so David Gilmour was recruited; Barrett left the band before the album's completion.\nWhereas Barrett had been the primary songwriter on Pink Floyd's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967), on A Saucerful of Secrets each member contributed songwriting and lead vocals. Gilmour appeared on all but two songs, while Barrett contributed to three. \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" is the only song on which all five members appear.\nFollowing \"Remember a Day,\" the sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets included several unreleased tracks that showcased Syd Barrett's increasingly erratic state of mind. Songs like \"Vegetable Man,\" a raw and chaotic composition about alienation, and \"Scream Thy Last Scream,\" with its unsettling vocals and disjointed structure, reflected Barrett's deteriorating mental health and growing detachment from reality. Other tracks, such as \"Reaction in G\" captured his unpredictable creativity, blending surreal lyrics with experimental sounds. These recordings, largely unreleased at the time due to their unconventional nature and concerns about Barrett's condition, provide a stark contrast to the band's earlier work and highlight the challenges Pink Floyd faced during this transitional period.\nA Saucerful of Secrets reached number nine in the UK charts, but did not chart in the US until April 2019, peaking at number 158. It received mostly positive reviews, though many critics have deemed it inferior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.",

                "content": "Pink Floyd released their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, in August 1967. Work began on A Saucerful of Secrets in the same month at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London with the producer Norman Smith. The first songs recorded were \"Scream Thy Last Scream\", written by the singer and guitarist, Syd Barrett, and \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\", written by the bassist, Roger Waters; despite having only two complete takes of the former, \"Scream Thy Last Scream\" was viewed as a potential single. Both songs were recorded on 7 and 8 August 1967. They were planned for release as a single on 8 September, but this was vetoed by Pink Floyd's record company, EMI.\nFollowing a brief European tour, in early October of '67, the band returned to the studio and recorded \"Vegetable Man\", another Syd Barrett composition (who also performed lead vocals), and \"Scream Thy Last Scream\" which was again rescheduled for release, only this time with \"Vegetable Man\" as the B-side, but it was once again vetoed by their label EMI. The band returned on 19 October to record \"Jugband Blues\", another Barrett composition, with Smith booking a Salvation Army brass band on Barrett's recommendation. During these sessions, Barrett, overdubbed slide guitar onto \"Remember a Day\", an outtake from The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. In late October, the band took a break from the album sessions to record what was to be the third and final Pink Floyd single by Barrett, \"Apples and Oranges\", on 26 and 27 October. A few days later, they recorded what would become the B-side, \"Paint Box\", before leaving for their first US tour. On 17 November 1967, \"Apples and Oranges\" was released as a single following Pink Floyd's US tour. Despite the band performing it on American Bandstand on 7 November which was their US television debut, it only reached number 55 in the UK charts, thus failing to match the chart success of their earlier singles \"See Emily Play\" and \"Arnold Layne\". Roger Waters later blamed Norman Smith's production for the single's failure to top the charts, stating \"'Apples and Oranges' was destroyed by the production. It's a fucking good song\". When asked in December 1967 by Melody Maker about the song's disappointing chart run, Barrett replied he \"couldn't care less really. All we can do is make records which we like. If the kids don't, then they won't buy it. All middle men are bad.\"\nAround this time, the mental health of guitarist Syd Barrett was being called into question by the band; he was often unresponsive and would not play, leading to the cancellation of several performances and Pink Floyd's first US tour. In December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added the guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member. According to Jenner, the group planned that Gilmour would \"cover for [Barrett's] eccentricities\". When this proved unworkable, \"Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved.\"\nFor two days from 10 January 1968, Pink Floyd reconvened at EMI Studios, attempting to work on older tracks: Waters' vocals and keyboardist Richard Wright's organ were overdubbed onto \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\", while drummer Nick Mason added vocals to \"Scream Thy Last Scream\".\nFrom 12 January till the 20th, Pink Floyd performed briefly as a five-piece. Gilmour played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage, occasionally joining in with the playing. Between these gigs, the group rehearsed new songs written by Waters on 15 and 16 January. During the next session, on 18 January, the band jammed on rhythm tracks, joined by Smith; Barrett did not attend. On 24 and 25 January, they recorded a song logged as \"The Most Boring Song I've Ever Heard Bar 2\" at EMI. The band recorded \"Let There Be More Light\", \"Corporal Clegg\" (which features lead vocals by Mason), and \"See-Saw\", all without Barrett, though manager Andrew King said Barrett performed the slide solo at the end of \"Let There Be More Light\".\nOn 26 January 1968, when the band was driving to a show at Southampton University, they decided not to pick up Barrett. Barrett was finally ousted in late January 1968, leaving the band to finish the album without him. \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" is the only song on which all five band members appeared. With Barrett removed from the sessions, the band struggled to come up with new material, but in February 1968 recorded Wright's \"It Would Be So Nice\" and Waters' \"Julia Dream\". In early February, it was announced Waters’ track \"Corporal Clegg\" would be the next single; however, due to pressure from the label, the song was earmarked for the album, and \"It Would Be So Nice\" was released in April, with \"Julia Dream\" on the B-side. The single failed to make the charts.\nThroughout April, the band took stock of their work. Waters blocked \"Vegetable Man\" and \"Scream Thy Last Scream\" from the album.  Years later Nick Mason had offered the following opinion on the two tracks not being included in the album: \"they were initially intended to be potential singles, but were never satisfactorily finished.  Both of these had vocals from me included in the mix, which may have had some bearing on the matter.\"\nIn lieu of the two songs, the band retained \"Jugband Blues\" and \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\". Without enough material to fill an album, the band started putting together music that became the title track. Mason and Waters planned it out as if it were an architectural design, including peaks and troughs. Smith did not approve, telling them they had to stick to three-minute songs. On 25 June, the band recorded another session for the BBC radio show Top Gear, including two tracks from the album: the session featured two tracks from Saucerful: \"Let There Be More Light\" and an abridged version of the title track, \"The Massed Gadgets of Hercules\".",

                "content": "Unlike The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, which was dominated by Barrett's compositions, A Saucerful of Secrets contains only one Barrett original: \"Jugband Blues\". Ritchie Unterberger of AllMusic assessed that with A Saucerful of Secrets, \"the band begin to map out the dark and repetitive pulses that would characterize their next few records.\" He described the sound as \"spacy, ethereal material\" that still \"retain[ed the] gentle, fairy-tale ambience\" of the previous album.\nWith Barrett seemingly detached from proceedings, it came down to Waters and Wright to provide adequate material. The opening, \"Let There Be More Light\", written by Waters, continues the space rock approach established by Barrett on their debut LP on songs like \"Astronomy Domine\" and \"Interstellar Overdrive\". \"Let There Be More Light\" evolved from a bass riff that was part of \"Interstellar Overdrive\". Both \"Remember a Day\" and \"See-Saw\" use a similar whimsical approach that Barrett had also established on their debut. Wright remained critical of his early contributions to the band.\n\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" was first performed with Barrett in 1967. The success of the track was such that it remained in their live setlist until 1973 where it appeared in a greatly extended form. Waters later performed the track during solo concerts from 1984 and later. Waters borrowed the lyrics from a book of Chinese poetry from the Tang dynasty, like Barrett had used in \"Chapter 24\".\n\"Corporal Clegg\" is the first Pink Floyd song to address issues of war, a theme which would endure throughout the career of Waters as a songwriter for the band, culminating on the 1983 album The Final Cut. The title track was originally written as a new version of \"Nick's Boogie\". The track is titled as four parts on Ummagumma. A staple in the band's live set until summer 1972, a live version of the song was recorded on 27 April 1969 at the Mothers Club in Birmingham for inclusion on Ummagumma.\n\"Jugband Blues\" is often thought to refer to Barrett's departure from the group (\"It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here / And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here\"). A promotional video was recorded for the track. The band's management wanted to release the song as a single, but it was vetoed by the band and Smith.",

Two additional Barrett songs, \"In the Beechwoods\", and \"No Title\" (frequently referred to on bootlegs as \"Sunshine\"), were recorded early in the album sessions. After years of only being available via bootlegs, \"Vegetable Man\", \"Scream Thy Last Scream\", and \"In the Beechwoods\" were officially released on The Early Years 1965–1972 compilation. At least one other song, \"John Latham\", was recorded during these sessions and has been released.",

It was released in the US by the Tower Records division of Capitol, where it was the only Pink Floyd album not to chart until 2019, when it peaked at 158. However, when reissued as A Nice Pair with the original version of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn after the success of The Dark Side of the Moon, the album did chart at number 36 on the Billboard 200. \"Let There Be More Light\" was released as a single, backed with \"Remember a Day\", in the US on 19 August 1968. Rolling Stone was unfavourable, writing that the album was \"not as interesting as their first\" and \"rather mediocre\", highlighting the reduced contributions from Barrett. However, in recent years via The Rolling Stone Album Guide, it was given an updated rating of 3 stars, which indicates a positive rating.\nThe stereo mix of the album was first released on CD in 1988, and in 1992 was digitally remastered and reissued as part of the Shine On box set. The remastered stereo CD was released on its own in 1994 in the UK and the US. The mono version of the album has never been officially released on CD. The stereo mix was remastered and re-issued in 2011 by Capitol/EMI as part of the Discovery series, and again in 2016 by Sony Music under the Pink Floyd Records label. The mono mix was reissued on vinyl for Record Store Day in April 2019 by Sony Music and Warner Music Group under the Pink Floyd Records label. The album finally charted on the Billboard 200 as a standalone peaking at No. 158 when the mono mix was re-released for Record Store Day.\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger draws attention to the album's \"gentle, fairy-tale ambience\", with songs that move from \"concise and vivid\" to \"spacy, ethereal material with lengthy instrumental passages\". In a review for BBC Music, Daryl Easlea said Saucerful was \"not without filler\", adding that \"Jugband Blues\" was \"the most chilling\" song on the album.\nIn 2014, Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets his favourite Pink Floyd album: \"I think there are ideas contained there that we have continued to use all the way through our career. I think [it] was a quite good way of marking Syd's departure and Dave's arrival. It's rather nice to have it on one record, where you get both things. It's a cross-fade rather than a cut.\"",

        "summary": "Ummagumma is a part-studio, part-live album by the English rock band Pink Floyd. It is a double album and was released on 7 November 1969 by Harvest Records. The first disc consists of live recordings from concerts at Mothers Club in Birmingham and the College of Commerce in Manchester that contained part of their normal set list of the time, while the second contains solo compositions by each member of the band recorded at EMI Studios, counting as Pink Floyd's fourth studio album. The artwork was designed by regular Pink Floyd collaborators Hipgnosis and features a number of pictures of the band combined to give a Droste effect.\nThe album's title supposedly comes from Cambridge slang for sex, commonly used by Pink Floyd friend and occasional roadie Iain \"Emo\" Moore, who would say, \"I'm going back to the house for some ummagumma\". According to Moore, he made up the term himself. Drummer Nick Mason later said the album was titled \"because it sounded interesting and nice.\"\nAlthough Ummagumma was well received at the time of release, and was a top-five hit in the UK album charts, it has since been looked upon unfavourably by critics and by the band, who have expressed lukewarm opinions about it in interviews. The album has been reissued on CD several times, along with the rest of their catalogue.",

                "content": "The original idea behind the live album was to feature fan favourites that would subsequently be dropped from the set. Although the sleeve notes say that the live material was recorded in June 1969, the live album of Ummagumma was recorded live at Mothers Club in Birmingham on 27 April 1969 and the following week at Manchester College of Commerce on 2 May as part of The Man and The Journey Tour. Keyboardist Richard Wright later said the recording of \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" was a composite from both gigs. A show at Bromley Technical College on 26 April was also recorded but not used. The band had also recorded a live version of \"Interstellar Overdrive\" (from The Piper at the Gates of Dawn) intended for placement on side one of the live album, and \"Embryo\", which was recorded in the studio before it was decided that the band members each come up with their own material.\nThe studio album was recorded in stages between September 1968 and July 1969. The structure came as a result of Wright wanting to make \"real music\", where the four group members (in order: Wright, Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Mason) each had half an LP side to create a solo work without involvement from the others. Wright's contribution, \"Sysyphus\", was named after a character in Greek mythology, usually spelled \"Sisyphus\", and contained a combination of various keyboards, including piano and Mellotron. Although initially enthusiastic about making a solo contribution, Wright later described it as \"pretentious\".\nWaters' \"Grantchester Meadows\" was a more pastoral acoustic offering that referred back to his youth in the Cambridge suburbs. It originated from an instrumental piece that had been occasionally performed live and was usually played as an opening to concerts during 1969, with vocals.  His other track, \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\", contained a variety of vocal and percussion effects treated at various speeds, both forwards and backwards, and was influenced by Ron Geesin, who would later collaborate with both Waters and Pink Floyd.  The two tracks were bridged by the sound of a fly being swatted.\nGilmour has since stated he was apprehensive about creating a solo work, and admits he \"went into a studio and started waffling about, tacking bits and pieces together\", although part one of \"The Narrow Way\" had already been performed as \"Baby Blue Shuffle in D Major\" in a BBC radio session in December 1968. Gilmour said he \"just bullshitted\" through the piece. He asked Waters to write some lyrics for his compositions, but Waters refused to do so. The third part of the suite was briefly performed live in early 1969.\nMason's three-part \"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\" featured his then wife, Lindy, playing uncredited flute on the first and third parts. The seven-minute second part incorporated percussion, tape effects and drum soloing. Although this track was not performed live, a similar drum solo, \"Doing It\", was incorporated into The Man live suite.",

The cover artwork shows a Droste effect featuring the group, with a picture hanging on the wall showing the same scene, except that the band members have switched positions, and this is  then repeated two more times. On most older editions, in the very center of the Droste pattern is a tiny rendering of the band's previous LP A Saucerful of Secrets; newer editions depict the Droste pattern repeating indefinitely. The cover of the original LP varies between the British, United States, Canadian and Australian releases. The British version has the Gigi soundtrack album leaning against the wall immediately above the \"Pink Floyd\" letters. Storm Thorgerson explained that the album was introduced as a red herring to provoke debate, and that it has no intended meaning. On most copies of US and Canadian editions, the Gigi cover is airbrushed to a plain white sleeve, apparently because of copyright concerns, but the earliest US copies do show the Gigi cover, and it was restored for the US remastered CD edition. On the Australian edition, the Gigi cover is completely airbrushed, not even leaving a white square behind. The house used as the location for the front cover of the album is located in Great Shelford, near Cambridge.\nOn the rear cover, roadies Alan Styles (who also appears in \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\") and Peter Watts are shown with the band's equipment laid out on a taxiway at London Biggin Hill Airport. This concept was proposed by Mason, with the intention of replicating the \"exploded\" drawings of military aircraft and their payloads, which were popular at the time. The inner gatefold art shows separate black-and-white photos of the band members. Gilmour is seen standing in front of the Elfin Oak. Original vinyl editions showed Waters with his first wife, Judy Trim, but she has been cropped out of the picture on most CD editions (with the original photo's caption \"Roger Waters (and Jude)\" accordingly changed to just \"Roger Waters\"). The uncropped picture was restored for the album's inclusion in the box set Oh, by the Way.\nOn the US and Canadian release there are additional titles of the four sections of the song \"A Saucerful of Secrets\". These titles did not appear on British editions, nor on any copies of the earlier album A Saucerful of Secrets.",

US versions of the cassette retained only \"Astronomy Domine\" from the live set and omitted the three other tracks. In 1987, the album was re-released on a two-CD set. A digitally remastered version was issued in 1994.\nIn 2009, to mark the 40th anniversary of the album's release, Thorgerson sold a limited number of autographed lithographs of the front cover.\nIn 2011, it was reissued featuring a remastered version with various other material. Although the 2011 re-release campaign Why Pink Floyd...? presented all fourteen albums newly remastered in 2011, only the studio disc of Ummagumma was remastered – the live disc is the previous 1994 version.

                "content": "On release, Ummagumma received favourable reviews. International Times was particularly positive about the live album, with the reviewer describing it as \"probably one of the best live recordings I have ever heard\". Stylus Magazine was very positive towards the album, saying the live album was \"as a visceral document of the early Floyd's proclivity for atmospheric, energetic jamming, there's nothing else like it\" and that the studio one \"somehow transcends its fractured construction to make a full album-length statement\".\nHowever, retrospective reviewers have given it mixed-to-negative ratings. Rolling Stone and MusicHound each awarded the album a score of 2.5 out of 5, while Paste, reviewing the 2011 re-release, described the album as \"rock excess of the worst kind\", although the writer praised the live version of \"Careful with that Axe, Eugene\". In his review for the Pink Floyd studio album Atom Heart Mother (1970), Robert Christgau suggested that Ummagumma's \"hypnotic melodies\" made it \"an admirable record to fall asleep to\". Paul Stump, in his book The Music's All that Matters: A History of Progressive Rock, approved of the first disc for its \"often involvingly spiritual live improvisation\", while deriding most of the studio disc, going so far as to liken \"Sysyphus\" to \"an excitable two-year-old let loose on the bass end of a piano keyboard\". However, he praised both of Waters's solo contributions and the editing and splicing techniques used on \"The Grand Vizier's Tea Party\". Bradley Smith's The Billboard Guide to Progressive Music (1997) recognises the studio disc as the more significant half of the record and also as \"perhaps one of the most adventurous recordings ever released by a major label group.\"\nThe band have since been dismissive and critical of the work. Recalling the album in later years, Waters said: \"Ummagumma – what a disaster!\" In 1995, Gilmour described the album as \"horrible\", though he thought the live album might be acceptable musically. In a 1984 interview, Mason said: \"I thought it was a very good and interesting little exercise, the whole business of everyone doing a bit. But I still feel really that that's quite a good example of the sum being greater than the parts ...\" Later, he described it as \"a failed experiment\", adding that \"the most significant thing is that we didn't do it again\".",

        "summary": "The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records. It is the last album to include all four post-Barrett-era band members. The album is a rock opera which follows the story of \"Pink\", a jaded rock star, as he constructs a psychological \"wall\" of social isolation. The Wall topped the US charts for 15 weeks and reached number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time.\nThe group's bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh tour, modelling the character of Pink after himself and former member Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. Co-producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band members were struggling with personal and financial problems. The group's keyboardist, Richard Wright, was fired by Waters during production but stayed on during the tour as a salaried musician.\nThree singles were issued: \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (Pink Floyd's only UK and US number-one single), \"Run Like Hell\", and \"Comfortably Numb\". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature film written by Waters.\nThe Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second-best-selling Pink Floyd album behind The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), the best-selling double album of all time, and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Some outtakes were used on the next Pink Floyd album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new The Wall live tour that became one of the highest-grossing tours by a solo musician. In 2011, Waters declared The Wall to be his favourite album he recorded with Pink Floyd.",

                "content": "Throughout 1977, Pink Floyd played the In the Flesh tour to promote their new album Animals. Roger Waters despised the experience – angered by the audience's rowdy behavior (such as setting off fireworks in the middle of songs) and convinced that they were not really listening to the music. During the final show on 6 July 1977 at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters so much that he leaned over the side and spat on one of them. Said Waters of the incident, \"Immediately afterwards I was shocked by my behaviour. I realised that what had once been a worthwhile and manageable exchange between us (the band) and them (the audience) had been utterly perverted by scale, corporate avarice and ego. All that remained was an arrangement that was essentially sado-masochistic.\" That night, Waters spoke with producer Bob Ezrin and a psychiatrist friend of Ezrin's about the alienation and despair he was experiencing. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the band and the audience. The concept was an instant source of inspiration.\nWhile Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and the drummer, Nick Mason, was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a child.\nIn July 1978, Pink Floyd reconvened at Britannia Row Studios, where Waters presented two new ideas for concept albums. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall. The second was about a man's dreams on one night, and dealt with marriage, sex, and the pros and cons of monogamy and family life versus promiscuity. The band chose the first option; the second eventually became Waters's debut solo studio album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984).\nBy September, Pink Floyd were having financial problems and urgently needed to produce an album to make money. The financial planners Norton Warburg Group (NWG) had invested £1.3–3.3 million, up to £23.9 million in contemporary value, of the group's money in high-risk venture capital to reduce their tax liabilities. The strategy failed when many of the businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 per cent. Waters said: \"Eighty-three per cent was a lot of money in those days and we didn't have it.\" Pink Floyd terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of uninvested funds. Gilmour said he became closely involved in the business side of Pink Floyd afterwards: \"Ever since then, there's not a penny that I haven't signed for. I sign every cheque and examine everything.\"\nTo help manage the project's 26 tracks, Waters decided to bring in an outside producer and collaborator, feeling he needed \"a collaborator who was musically and intellectually in a similar place to where I was\". They hired Ezrin at the suggestion of Waters's then-wife Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary. Ezrin had previously worked with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, Kiss, and Peter Gabriel. From the start, Waters made it clear who was in charge, telling him: \"You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit.\"\nWaters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. Ezrin presented a 40-page script to the rest of the band, with positive results. He recalled: \"The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album.\" Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written and basing it on a composite character named Pink. The engineer Nick Griffiths later said: \"Ezrin was very good in The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them.\" Waters wrote most of the album, with Gilmour co-writing \"Comfortably Numb\", \"Run Like Hell\", and \"Young Lust\", and Ezrin co-writing \"The Trial\".",

                "content": "The Wall is a rock opera that explores abandonment, cycles of violence, and isolation, symbolized by a wall. The songs create a storyline of events in the life of Pink, a fictional rock star based on Waters and Pink Floyd's former frontman Syd Barrett. The first half of the album largely features events from Waters' childhood and young adulthood, such as the death of his father in WWII, and his wife's infidelity. The album also includes several references to Barrett, namely the track \"Nobody Home\", which mirrors lyrically one of Barrett's final songs for the Floyd, the unreleased B side \"Vegetable Man\" through descriptions of the narrator's possessions and character. \"Comfortably Numb\" was inspired by Waters' injection with a muscle relaxant to combat the effects of hepatitis during the In the Flesh tour in Philadelphia. In the song \"In the Flesh\" Waters \"imagines himself as a fascist dictator\".",

                        "content": "The album opens with Pink, a rock star, addressing a crowd of fans at one of his concerts, to whom he is about to give an apparently unexpected performance of his life story (\"In the Flesh?\"). A flashback on his life up to that point begins, in which it is revealed that his father was killed during World War II, leaving Pink's mother to raise him alone (\"The Thin Ice\"). Beginning with the death of his father, Pink starts to build a metaphorical wall around himself (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1\"). Growing older, Pink is tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers (\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\"), and memories of these traumas become metaphorical \"bricks in the wall\" (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\").\n\nNow an adult, Pink remembers his domineering, overprotective mother (\"Mother\") and his upbringing during the Blitz (\"Goodbye Blue Sky\"). Pink soon marries, and after more \"bricks\" are created through more traumas, he is preparing to complete his \"wall\" (\"Empty Spaces\"). While touring in the United States, he seeks casual sex to relieve the tedium of touring, though in making a phone call home, he learns of his wife's infidelity (\"Young Lust\"). He brings a groupie back to his hotel room, only to trash it in a violent fit of rage, terrifying her out of the room (\"One of My Turns\"). Depressed, Pink thinks about his wife and fantasizes about committing violence against her (\"Don't Leave Me Now\"). Feeling trapped, he dismisses the impact his past has had on him while rejecting human contact and medication (\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3\"). Pink's wall is now finished, completely isolating himself from the outside world (\"Goodbye Cruel World\").\nImmediately after the wall's completion, Pink questions his decisions (\"Hey You\") and locks himself in his hotel room (\"Is There Anybody Out There?\"). As his depression worsens, Pink turns to his possessions for comfort (\"Nobody Home\"), and yearns for the idea of reconnecting with his personal roots (\"Vera\"). Pink's mind flashes back to World War II, with the people demanding that the soldiers return home (\"Bring the Boys Back Home\"). Returning to the present, Pink's manager and roadies break into his hotel room, where they find him unresponsive. A paramedic injects him with drugs to enable him to perform at a concert later that night (\"Comfortably Numb\").\nThe drugs kick in, resulting in a hallucinatory on-stage performance (\"The Show Must Go On\") where he believes that he is a fascist dictator, and that his concert is a Neo-Nazi rally, at which he sets brownshirt-like men on fans that he considers unworthy (\"In the Flesh\"). He proceeds to attack minorities (\"Run Like Hell\"), culminating in him imagining holding a violence-inciting rally in suburban London (\"Waiting for the Worms\"). Pink's hallucination then ceases, and he begs for everything to stop (\"Stop\"). Tormented with guilt, Pink places himself on trial before his inner judge, who orders him to \"tear down the wall\" as punishment for his actions (\"The Trial\"). This is the opening of Pink to the outside world (\"Outside the Wall\").\nThe album turns full circle with its closing words \"Isn't this where...\", the first words of the phrase that begins the album, \"...we came in?\", with a continuation of the melody of the last song hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters' theme, and that the existential crisis at the heart of the album will never truly end.",

                        "content": "The Wall was recorded in several locations. Super Bear Studios in France was used between January and July 1979, and Waters recorded his vocals at the nearby Studio Miraval. Michael Kamen supervised the orchestral arrangements at CBS Studios in New York in September. Over the next two months the band used Cherokee Studios, Producers Workshop and The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. A plan to work with the Beach Boys at the Sundance Productions studio in Los Angeles was cancelled (although Beach Boys member Bruce Johnston does sing backing vocals on \"In the Flesh?\", \"The Show Must Go On\", the side 4 version of \"In the Flesh\", and \"Waiting for the Worms\").\nJames Guthrie, recommended by previous Floyd collaborator Alan Parsons, arrived early in the production process. He replaced engineer Brian Humphries, who was emotionally drained by his five years with the band. Guthrie was hired as a co-producer, but was initially unaware of Ezrin's role: \"I saw myself as a hot young producer ... When we arrived, I think we both felt we'd been booked to do the same job.\" The early sessions at Britannia Row were emotionally charged, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters each had strong ideas about the direction the album would take. Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin became an intermediary between Waters and the rest of the band.\nAs Britannia Row was initially regarded as inadequate for The Wall, the band upgraded much of its equipment, and by March another set of demos was complete. However, their former relationship with NWG placed them at risk of bankruptcy, and they were advised to leave the UK by no later than 6 April 1979, for a minimum of one year. As non-residents they would pay no UK taxes during that time, and within a month all four members and their families had left. Waters moved to Switzerland, Mason to France, and Gilmour and Wright to the Greek Islands. Some equipment from Britannia Row was relocated in Super Bear Studios near Nice. Gilmour and Wright were both familiar with the studio and enjoyed its atmosphere, having recorded solo albums there. While Wright and Mason lived at the studio, Waters and Gilmour stayed in nearby houses. Mason later moved into Waters's villa near Vence, while Ezrin stayed in Nice.\nEzrin's poor punctuality caused problems with the tight schedule followed by Waters. Mason found Ezrin's behaviour \"erratic\", but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his lateness as ammunition for \"tongue-in-cheek resentment\". Ezrin's share of the royalties was less than the rest of the band and he viewed Waters as a bully, especially when Waters mocked him by having badges made that read NOPE (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share. Ezrin later said he had had marital problems and was not \"in the best shape emotionally\".\n\nMore problems became apparent when Waters's relationship with Wright broke down. The band were rarely in the studio together. Ezrin and Guthrie spliced Mason's previously recorded drum tracks together, and Guthrie worked with Waters and Gilmour during the day, returning at night to record Wright's contributions. Wright, worried about the effect that the introduction of Ezrin would have on band relationships, was keen to have a producer's credit on the album. Their albums since More (1969) had credited production to \"Pink Floyd\".\nWaters agreed to a trial period with Wright producing, after which he was to be given a producer's credit, but after a few weeks he and Ezrin expressed dissatisfaction with Wright's methods. A confrontation with Ezrin led to Wright working only at nights. Gilmour also expressed his annoyance, complaining that Wright's lack of input was \"driving us all mad\". Ezrin later reflected: \"it sometimes felt that Roger was setting him up to fail. Rick gets performance anxiety. You have to leave him alone to freeform, to create ...\"\nWright was troubled by a failing marriage and the onset of depression, exacerbated by his non-residency. While the other band members brought their children, Wright's children were older and could not join as they were attending school; he said he missed them \"terribly\". The band's holidays were booked for August, after which they were to reconvene at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, but Columbia offered the band a better deal in exchange for a Christmas release of the album. Waters increased the band's workload accordingly, booking time at the nearby Studio Miraval. He also suggested recording in Los Angeles ten days earlier than agreed, and hiring another keyboardist to work alongside Wright, whose keyboard parts had not yet been recorded. Wright refused to cut short his family holiday in Rhodes.\nAccounts of Wright's subsequent departure from the band differ. In his autobiography, Inside Out, Mason says that Waters called the band's manager, Steve O'Rourke, who was travelling to the US on the QE2, and told him to have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album. In another version recorded by a later historian of the band, Waters called O'Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements, to which Wright responded: \"Tell Roger to fuck off\". Wright denied this, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer, and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Mason later wrote that Waters was \"stunned and furious\", and felt that Wright was not doing enough.\nGilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learnt of Waters's ultimatum, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but reminded him about his minimal contributions. Waters insisted that Wright leave, or he would refuse to release The Wall. Several days later, worried about their financial situation and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit. News of his departure was kept from the music press. Although his name did not appear on some editions of the album (it does appear on the UK gatefold sleeve), he was employed as a session musician on the band's subsequent tour.\nBy August 1979, the running order was largely complete. Wright completed his duties at Cherokee Studios aided by session musicians Peter Wood and Fred Mandel, and Jeff Porcaro played drums in Mason's stead on \"Mother\". Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, and travelled to New York to record his debut solo album, Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports. In advance of its release, technical constraints led to some changes to the running order and content of The Wall, with \"What Shall We Do Now?\" replaced by the similar but shorter \"Empty Spaces\", and \"Hey You\" being moved from the end of side three to the beginning. With the November 1979 deadline approaching, the band left the inner sleeves of the album unchanged.",

                        "content": "Mason's early drum sessions were performed in an open space on the top floor of Britannia Row Studios. The 16-track recordings from these sessions were mixed down and copied onto a 24-track master, as guide tracks for the rest of the band to play to. This gave the engineers greater flexibility, but also improved the audio quality of the mix, as the original 16-track drum recordings were synced to the 24-track master and the duplicated guide tracks removed. Ezrin later related the band's alarm at this method of working – they apparently viewed the erasure of material from the 24-track master as \"witchcraft\".\nWhile at Super Bear studios, Waters agreed to Ezrin's suggestion that several tracks, including \"Nobody Home\", \"The Trial\" and \"Comfortably Numb\", should have an orchestral accompaniment. Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with David Bowie, was booked to oversee these arrangements, which were performed by musicians from the New York Philharmonic and New York Symphony Orchestras, and a choir from the New York City Opera. Their sessions were recorded at CBS Studios in New York without Pink Floyd present. Kamen eventually met the band once recording was complete.\n\n\"Comfortably Numb\" has its origins in Gilmour's debut solo album, and was the source of much argument between Waters and Gilmour. Ezrin claimed that the song initially started life as \"Roger's record, about Roger, for Roger\", but he thought that it needed further work. Waters changed the key of the verse and added more lyrics to the chorus, and Gilmour added extra bars for the line \"I have become comfortably numb\". Gilmour's \"stripped-down and harder\" recording was not to Waters's liking; Waters preferred Ezrin's \"grander Technicolor, orchestral version\". Following a major argument in a North Hollywood restaurant, the two compromised; the song's body included the orchestral arrangement, with Gilmour's second and final guitar solo standing alone.",

                        "content": "Waters and Ezrin oversaw the capture of the album's sound effects. Waters recorded the phone call used on the original demo for \"Young Lust\", but neglected to inform its recipient, Mason, who assumed it was a prank call and angrily hung up. A real telephone operator was also an unwitting participant. The call references Waters' viewpoint of his bitter 1975 divorce from first wife Judy. Waters also recorded ambient sounds along Hollywood Boulevard by hanging a microphone from a studio window. Engineer Phil Taylor recorded some of the screeching tyre noises on \"Run Like Hell\" from a studio car park, and a television set being destroyed was used on \"One of My Turns\". At Britannia Row Studios, Nick Griffiths recorded the smashing of crockery for the same song. Television broadcasts were used, and one actor, recognising his voice, accepted a financial settlement from the group in lieu of legal action against them.\n\nThe maniacal schoolmaster was voiced by Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the groupie's voice. Backing vocals were performed by a range of artists, although a planned appearance by the Beach Boys on \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"Waiting for the Worms\" was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Beach Boys touring musician Toni Tennille.\nEzrin's suggestion to release \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" as a single with a disco-style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. Waters opposed releasing a single, but became receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie's mix. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London with a request to find children to perform several versions of the lyrics. Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was enthusiastic, saying: \"I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – 'We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control ...'  I just thought it would be a wonderful experience for the kids.\"\nGriffiths first recorded small groups of pupils and then invited more, telling them to affect a Cockney accent and shout rather than sing. He multitracked the voices, making the groups sound larger, before sending his recordings back to Los Angeles. The result delighted Waters, and the song was released as a single, becoming a Christmas number one. There was some controversy when the British press reported that the children had not been paid for their efforts; they were eventually given copies of the album, and the school received a £1,000 donation (£5,000 in contemporary value).",

Matters had not been helped when Columbia Records offered Waters smaller publishing rights on the grounds that The Wall was a double album, a position he did not accept. When one executive offered to settle the dispute with a coin toss, Waters asked why he should gamble on something he owned. He eventually prevailed. The record company's concerns were alleviated when \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" reached number one in the UK, US, Norway, Portugal, West Germany and South Africa. It was certified platinum in the UK in December 1979, and platinum in the US three months later. In Germany, the album reached the one million sales mark within three months of its release. In Canada, the album was No. 1 for 13 weeks and had sold 830,000 copies by January 1981.\nThe Wall was released in the UK and in the US on 30 November 1979. Coinciding with its release, Waters was interviewed by veteran DJ Tommy Vance, who played the album in its entirety on BBC Radio 1. It was reissued in three versions as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, which featured a massive restoration of the band's catalogue with remastering by producer James Guthrie: a \"Discovery\" edition in 2011, featuring the remastered version with no extras, and the \"Experience\" edition, which adds a bonus disc of unreleased material and other supplementary items, and the \"Immersion\" edition, a seven-disc collection that also adds video materials, in 2012.",

The Wall is therefore the first album cover of the band since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not to be created by the design group.\nIssues of the album included the lettering of the artist name and album title by cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, either as a sticker on sleeve wrapping or printed onto the cover itself, in either black or red. Scarfe, who had previously created animations for the band's \"In the Flesh\" tour, also created the LP's inside sleeve art and labels of both vinyl records of the album, showing the eponymous wall in various stages of construction, accompanied by characters from the story.\nThe drawings were translated into dolls for The Wall Tour, as well as into Scarfe's animated segments shown during the tour and the film based on the album. It is notable that the stadium drawn in the inner sleeve highly resembles the Montreal Olympic Stadium where the album's concept happens to find its origin. It seems plausible that the artist was inspired by the stadium's appearance in 1977 and its inclined tower which was completed only at a third of its projected (and present) height, reminiscent of the many \"towers\" pictured in the artist's stadium.",

Reviewing for Rolling Stone in February 1980, Kurt Loder hailed it as \"a stunning synthesis of Waters's by now familiar thematic obsessions\" that \"leaps to life with a relentless lyrical rage that's clearly genuine and, in its painstaking particularity, ultimately horrifying.\" By contrast, The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau regarded it as \"a dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic\" backed by \"kitschy minimal maximalism with sound effects and speech fragments\", adding in The New York Times that its worldview is \"self-indulgent\" and \"presents the self-pity of its rich, famous and decidedly post-adolescent protagonist as a species of heroism\". Melody Maker declared, \"I'm not sure whether it's brilliant or terrible, but I find it utterly compelling.\"\nThe album topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 15 weeks, selling over a million copies in its first two months of sales and in 1999, it was certified 23× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time in the US, having sold over 19 million copies worldwide between 1979 and 1990. The Wall is Pink Floyd's second-best selling album after their eighth studio album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). Engineer James Guthrie's efforts were rewarded in 1980 with a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Recording (non-classical), and the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Rolling Stone placed it at number 87 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, although this was updated to 129 with the list's 2020 revision. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2006). In 2008, The Wall was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nIn retrospective, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins praised The Wall during his speech at the Pink Floyd induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In his teens, he felt the album was: \"..too creepy, too intense, too nihilistic. And, of course, these are all the things that I believe in now… But at twenty-eight years old, it's one of the bravest records I've ever heard. And I really can't point to anything else that's ever summed up everything that's fucked up about life; everything that's fucked up about rock. It takes on politics, hero worship, rock 'n' roll, and our desires to connect with the universe, all in one fell swoop. It really, truly, is an amazing testament to how far they were willing to go to reach the outer limits of what's important.\" \"The Wall is stupefyingly good,\" Waters declared in 1992. \"Christ, what a brilliant idea that was. It holds together so well… And of course Dave's musical influence on that was considerable. Despite what has happened between us since then, I still have great respect for him as a guitarist.\"",

                "content": "The Wall Tour was launched at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on 7 February 1980. Touring continued throughout 1980 and 1981 in New York, London, and Dortmund. In comparison to previous tours, the audiences were much smaller to support the album's concept of alienation from society. By this time, Pink Floyd concerts had garnered a reputation for spectacle, and The Wall Tour built upon it. Most famously each show featured a 40-foot (12 m) wall of 340 cardboard bricks, gradually constructed between the band and the audience. Gerald Scarfe projected a series of animations onto the wall. At his London studio, he employed a team of 40 animators to create Pink's nightmarish visions, many of which were re-used in the film version of The Wall.\nUnbeknownst to the audience, at the beginning of each show the members of Pink Floyd had been substituted with a \"surrogate band\" wearing hyper-realistic face masks of each of the actual members. At the end of the opening number (\"In the Flesh?\"), the surrogates froze in place, and lights revealed the actual band behind them. The surrogates would then later re-appear without the masks as backing musicians.  Throughout the show, three characters taken from The Wall made appearances as giant inflatables looming over the stage – Pink's schoolmaster, his mother, and his wife. During \"In the Flesh\", an inflatable pig also floated over the audience (a carryover from prior tours), this time sporting a crossed hammers logo that matched the uniforms of the band and stage crew. Along with the original album tracks, the tour featured an instrumental medley, \"The Last Few Bricks\", played before \"Goodbye Cruel World\" to allow the construction crew to complete the wall. \"Empty Spaces\" was replaced by a longer version of the track, \"What Shall We Do Now?\".\nDuring the tour, band relationships dropped to an all-time low; at one point, they stayed in four Winnebagos parked in a circle with the doors facing away from the centre. Waters, however, used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue, and stayed in separate hotels from the rest of the band. Ultimately, Wright, returning as a salaried musician, was the only member of the band to profit from the tour, which lost about £400,000.",

It used Scarfe's animation alongside actors, with little conventional dialogue. A modified soundtrack was created for some of the film's songs.\nOn 21 July 1990, Waters and producer Tony Hollingsworth created The Wall – Live in Berlin, staged for charity at a site once occupied by part of the Berlin Wall. The concert included several artists and celebrities popular at the time, including Scorpions, Cyndi Lauper, Sinéad O'Connor, Joni Mitchell, Ute Lemper, Tim Curry, Van Morrison, and Bryan Adams among others.\nIn 2000, Pink Floyd released Is There Anybody Out There?

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)",
        "summary": "Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 12 September 1975 through Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and a day later in the United States through Columbia Records, their first for the label. Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded over numerous sessions throughout 1975 at EMI Studios in London.\nThe lyrics express longing, alienation, and sardonic criticism of the music industry. The bulk of the album is taken up by \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", a nine-part tribute to Syd Barrett, a Pink Floyd co-founder who had left seven years earlier due to his deteriorating mental health. Barrett coincidentally visited the studio during recording. As with their previous release, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink Floyd employed studio effects and synthesisers. Guest singers included Roy Harper, who sang lead on \"Have a Cigar\", and Venetta Fields, who sang backing vocals on \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". To promote the album, Pink Floyd released the double A-side single \"Have a Cigar\" / \"Welcome to the Machine\".\nWish You Were Here topped charts in several countries, including the UK Albums Chart and US Billboard 200. It was certified gold in the UK and US in its year of release, and by 2004, it had sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, who found its music \"uninspiring\" and \"inferior\" to the group's previous work. However, it has later been acclaimed as one of the greatest albums of all time, with Rolling Stone ranking it number 264 in their 2023 revision of their \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list. Keyboardist Richard Wright, drummer Nick Mason, and guitarist David Gilmour have cited it as their favourite Pink Floyd album, while bassist Roger Waters called it their \"most complete\" album.",

These songs were performed during a series of concerts in France and England, the band's first tour since 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. As Pink Floyd had never employed a publicist and kept themselves distant from the press, their relationship with the media began to sour. Nick Mason said later that a critical NME review by Nick Kent, who Mason felt preferred the band's earlier music, may have influenced the band to return to the studio during the first week of 1975.",

                "content": "Wish You Were Here is the second Pink Floyd album with a conceptual theme, mostly at Roger Waters' direction, reflecting his feeling that the previous communal structure of the band had disappeared in favour of more professional musicianship. \"I had some criticisms of Dark Side of the Moon,\" noted David Gilmour, saying that \"[o]ne or two of the vehicles carrying the ideas were not as strong as the ideas that they carried. I thought we should try and work harder on marrying the idea and the vehicle that carried it, so that they both had an equal magic [...] It's something I was personally pushing when we made Wish You Were Here.\" The album begins with a long instrumental introduction shifting from ambient music to the main refrain of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", the lyrics of which were penned as a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier.\nWish You Were Here also features lyrical criticism of the rock music industry and the then-recent mainstream perception of the band. \"Shine On\" crosses seamlessly into \"Welcome to the Machine\", a song that begins with an opening door (described by Waters as a symbol of musical discovery and progress betrayed by a music industry more interested in greed and success) and ends with a party, the latter epitomising \"the lack of contact and real feelings between people\". Similarly, \"Have a Cigar\" scorns record industry \"fat-cats\" with the lyrics repeating a stream of clichés heard by rising newcomers in the industry, and including the question \"by the way, which one's Pink?\"; this was derived from an actual interaction with an agent who asked this of the band. The lyrics of the next song, \"Wish You Were Here\", relate both to Barrett's absence and to the dichotomy of Waters' character, with greed and ambition battling with compassion and idealism as the popularity of the band was growing.",

                "content": "Alan Parsons, EMI staff engineer for Pink Floyd's previous studio album, The Dark Side of the Moon, declined to continue working with them due to the recent formation of his own group and working on their first album. Pink Floyd had worked with engineer Brian Humphries on More, recorded at Pye Studios, and again in 1974 when he replaced an inexperienced concert engineer. Humphries, being a stranger to EMI's Abbey Road set-up, encountered some early difficulties. On one occasion, Humphries inadvertently spoiled the backing tracks for \"Shine On\", a piece that Waters and drummer Nick Mason had spent many hours perfecting, with echo. The entire piece had to be re-recorded.\nThe sessions for Wish You Were Here at EMI's Studio Three (now Abbey Road Studios) lasted from January until July 1975, recording on four days each week from 2:30 pm until very late in the evening. The group found it difficult at first to devise any new material, especially as the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left all four physically and emotionally drained. Keyboardist Richard Wright later described these sessions as \"falling within a difficult period\", and Waters recalled them as \"torturous\". Mason found the process of multi-track recording to be \"tedious\", while Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Gilmour was also becoming increasingly frustrated with Mason, whose failing marriage had brought on a general malaise and sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.\nGilmour said the band had realised their dreams of becoming rich and famous musicians, and so had to \"reassess what [they] were in it for thereafter, and it was a pretty confusing and sort of empty time for a while\". Humphries recalled days of inactivity: \"I don't think they knew what they wanted to do. We had a dartboard and an air rifle and we'd play these word games, sit around, get drunk, go home and return the next day. That's all we were doing until suddenly everything started falling into place.\"\nAfter several weeks, Waters began to visualise another concept. The three new compositions from the 1974 tours were at least a starting point for a new album, and \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. Mostly an instrumental 20-minute-plus piece similar to \"Echoes\", the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of Barrett. Gilmour had composed the phrase while improvising, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response to make it the focus of the song. A subtle refrain performed by Wright, lifted from \"See Emily Play\", is also audible towards the end. Waters wanted to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar\" were attacks on the music business, their lyrics working with \"Shine On\" to provide a summary of the rise and fall of Barrett; \"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\" \"Raving and Drooling\" and \"You've Got To Be Crazy\" had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977's Animals.",

That day, the band were completing the mix of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows entered, carrying a plastic bag. Waters did not recognise him, and Gilmour presumed he was an EMI staff member. Wright presumed he was a friend of Waters, but realised it was Barrett. Mason also failed to recognise him, and was \"horrified\" when Gilmour identified him. In Mason's memoir Inside Out, he recalled Barrett's conversation as \"desultory and not entirely sensible\". Storm Thorgerson would later reflect on Barrett's presence: \"Two or three people cried. He sat round and talked for a bit but he wasn't really there.\" According to Gilmour, Barrett \"came two or three days and then he didn't come any more.\"\nWaters was reportedly reduced to tears by the sight of his former bandmate. Fellow visitor Andrew King asked Barrett how he had gained weight; he said that he had been overeating while living in isolation. He showed an unexpected enthusiasm for participating in the recording of the album, but while listening to the mix of \"Shine On\", showed no signs of understanding its relevance to him. Barrett also joined Gilmour's wedding reception in the EMI canteen, but left unnoticed. Apart from Waters seeing Barrett in Harrods a couple of years later, it has been agreed by biographers and journalists to be the last time any member of the band saw him alive. This series of events is regarded to have tonally influenced the final version of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". Waters said later that \"'Shine On' is not really about Syd—he's just a symbol for all the extremes of absence some people have to indulge in because it's the only way they can cope with how fucking sad it is, modern life, to withdraw completely. I found that terribly sad.\"",

Wine glasses had been filled with varying amounts of fluid, and recordings were made of a wet finger circling the edge of each glass. These recordings were multi-tracked into chords.\nJazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli and classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin were performing in another studio in the building, and were invited to record a piece. Menuhin watched as Grappelli played on \"Wish You Were Here\"; however, the band later decided his contribution was unsuitable and Mason has erroneously stated that the piece was wiped. In actuality Grappelli's playing was included, but so low in the final mix that the band presumed it would be insulting to credit him. He was paid £300 (equivalent to £3,200 in 2023). Saxophonist Dick Parry, who had performed on The Dark Side of the Moon, performed on \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". The opening bars of \"Wish You Were Here\" were recorded from Gilmour's car radio, with somebody turning the dial (the classical music heard is the finale of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony).",

His problems stemmed in part from the stresses placed upon his voice while recording the lead vocals of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". Gilmour was asked to sing in his place, but declined, and eventually colleague and friend Roy Harper was asked to stand in. Harper was recording his own album in another of EMI's studios, and Gilmour had already performed some guitar licks for him.

Roy Harper, performing at the same event, on discovering that his stage costume was missing, proceeded to destroy one of Pink Floyd's vans, injuring himself in the process. This delayed the setup of the band's sound system. As a pair of World War II Spitfire aircraft had been booked to fly over the crowd during their entrance, the band were not able to delay their set. The result was that a power supply problem pushed Wright's keyboards completely out of tune, damaging the band's performance. At one point he left the stage, but the band were able to continue with a less sensitive keyboard, a piano and a simpler light show. Following a brief intermission, they returned to perform The Dark Side of the Moon, but critics displeased about being denied access backstage savaged the performance.",

This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve – censoring the cover image – and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art \"absent\"). The concept behind \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar\" suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background).\nThe cover images were photographed by Aubrey Powell, Thorgerson's partner at the design studio Hipgnosis, and inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of \"getting burned\", and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire. \"Getting burned\" was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments. Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell Jr. and Danny Rogers), the former dressed in a fireproof suit covered by a business suit. His head was protected by a hood, underneath a similarly fireproof wig, and fire-resistant gel was applied to him. The photograph was taken at Warner Bros. Studios in California, known at the time as The Burbank Studios. While the first fourteen takes were successful, Rondell suffered minor burns when the wind changed direction on the fifteenth, singeing his moustache. The two stuntmen changed positions, and the image was later reversed.\nThe back cover depicts a faceless \"Floyd salesman\", in Thorgerson's words, \"selling his soul\" in the desert (shot in the Yuma Desert in California again by Powell). The absence of wrists and ankles signifies his presence as an \"empty suit\". The inner sleeve shows a veil concealing a nude woman in a windswept Norfolk grove, and a splash-less diver at Mono Lake – titled Monosee (the German translation of Mono Lake) in the liner notes – in California (again emphasising the theme of absence). Various releases on vinyl included a postcard with this image. The decision to shroud the cover in black plastic was not popular with the band's US record company, Columbia Records, which insisted that it be changed but was over-ruled. EMI was less concerned; the band were reportedly extremely happy with the end product, and when presented with a pre-production mockup, they accepted it with a spontaneous round of applause.",

                "content": "Wish You Were Here was released on 12 September 1975 in the UK, and on the following day in the US. It was Pink Floyd's first album with Columbia Records, an affiliate of CBS; the band and their manager Steve O'Rourke had been dissatisfied with the efforts of EMI's US label Capitol Records. The band remained with EMI's Harvest Records in Europe.\nIn Britain, with 250,000 advance sales, the album debuted at number three and reached number one the following week. Demand was such that EMI informed retailers that only half of their orders would be fulfilled. With 900,000 advance orders (the largest for any Columbia release) it reached number one on the US Billboard chart in its second week. Wish You Were Here was Pink Floyd's fastest-selling album ever. It was certified silver and gold (60,000 and 100,000 sales respectively) in the UK on 1 August 1975, and Gold in the US on 17 September 1975. It was certified seven-times platinum in the US on 12 December 2025, and by 2004 had sold an estimated 13 million copies worldwide. \"Have a Cigar\" was chosen by Columbia as the first single, with \"Welcome to the Machine\" on the B-side in the US.",

                "content": "Wish You Were Here initially received mixed reviews. Ben Edmonds wrote in Rolling Stone that the band's \"lackadaisical demeanor\" leaves the subject of Barrett \"unrealised; they give such a matter-of-fact reading of the goddamn thing that they might as well be singing about Roger Waters's brother-in-law getting a parking ticket\". Edmonds concluded the band is \"devoid\" of the \"sincere passion for their 'art'\" that contemporary space rock acts purportedly have. Melody Maker's reviewer wrote: \"From whichever direction one approaches Wish You Were Here, it still sounds unconvincing in its ponderous sincerity and displays a critical lack of imagination in all departments.\" \nIn The Village Voice, Robert Christgau wrote: \"The music is not only simple and attractive, with the synthesizer used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously.\" Years later, he wrote that Wish You Were Here was his favourite Pink Floyd: \"It has soul [...] It's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero but as long as he's Roger's that doesn't matter.\" \nPaul Stump, in his 1997 History of Progressive Rock, argued that critical disappointment with Wish You Were Here was likely inevitable due to the monumental expectations of what \"was (at the time) the most eagerly anticipated rock album ever released. Even the announcement of its issue date was headline news. These hosannas were grounded on no more than the fact that it was simply the Floyd's follow-up to [The] Dark Side of the Moon, which represented, for many, the acme of the genre to date.\" He was critical of the dominance of synthesiser textures, saying it often made Wish You Were Here sound like a showcase for Wright's new equipment.\nWish You Were Here has been frequently named one of the greatest albums and one of the greatest progressive rock albums. In 2003, it was ranked at number 209 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, ranked at number 211 in a 2012 revised list, and ranked at number 264 in a 2023 revised list. In 2015, Rolling Stone named it the fourth-greatest progressive rock album. In 2014, Prog readers voted it the seventh-greatest progressive rock album. In 1998, Q readers voted Wish You Were Here the 34th-greatest album. In 2000, Q placed it at number 43 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2000, it was voted number 38 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2007, one of Germany's largest public radio stations, WDR 2, asked its listeners to vote for the 200 best albums of all time. Wish You Were Here was voted number one. In 2004, Wish You Were Here was ranked number 36 on the Pitchfork list of the Top 100 albums of the 1970s. IGN rated Wish You Were Here as the eighth-greatest classic rock album, and Ultimate Classic Rock placed Wish You Were Here as the second-best Pink Floyd album.\nWright and Gilmour cited Wish You Were Here as their favourite Pink Floyd album. Wright said: \"It's an album I can listen to for pleasure, and there aren't many Floyd albums that I can.\" Gilmour said: \"The end result of all that, whatever it was, definitely has left me an album I can live with very very happily. I like it very much.\" Waters said Wish You Were Here and The Dark Side of the Moon were the \"most complete\" Pink Floyd albums, and that Wish You Were Here and their next album, Animals (1977), \"signalled the end of the band as it had been before\".",

In the UK and US it was re-issued in quadraphonic using the SQ format in 1976, and in 1980 a special Hi-Fi Today audiophile print was released in the UK. It was released on CD in Japan in October 1982, in the US in 1983, and in the UK in 1985, and again as a remastered CD with new artwork in 1994. In the US, Columbia's CBS Mastersound label released a half-speed mastered audiophile LP in 1981, and in 1994 Sony Mastersound released a 24-carat gold-plated CD, remastered using Super Bit Mapping, with the original artwork from the LP in both longbox and jewel case forms, the latter with a cardboard slipcover. The album was included as part of the box set Shine On, and three years later Columbia Records released an updated remastered CD, 17 seconds longer than the EMI remasters from 1994, giving a running time of 44:28.\nThe label was a recreation of the original machine handshake logo, with a black and blue background. Wish You Were Here was rereleased in 2000 for its 25th anniversary, on the Capitol Records label in the US. It was re-released and remixed in 2011. The Wish You Were Here – Immersion Box Set includes the new stereo digital remaster (2011) by James Guthrie on CD, an unreleased 5.1 Surround Mix (2009) by James Guthrie on DVD and Blu-ray, a Quad Mix (which had been released only on vinyl LP and 8-track tape) on DVD, as well as the original stereo mix (1975) on DVD and Blu-ray. This campaign also featured the 2011 stereo remaster on 180g heavyweight vinyl, as well as the 2011 stereo remaster and the 5.1 surround sound mix (2009) as a hybrid Super Audio CD (SACD). In 2016, the 180g vinyl was rereleased on Pink Floyd Records (with distribution by Warner Music and Sony Music), remastered by James Guthrie, Joel Plante and Bernie Grundman. In September 2025, Sony announced a 50th-anniversary boxset, with a new Dolby Atmos mix, additional tracks and live performances, and a hardcover book.",
