## 2. Dataset Introduction

This dataset contains structured text from the introduction page of the English Wikipedia "Pink Floyd albums". The total of 16 albums is arranged in alphabetical order, including album titles, URLs, abstracts, and complete structure content. Dataset collection is accomplished via the Wikipedia API and retains the original structure of Wikipedia's hierarchical sections.

It can be used to study music industry topics (musical aesthetics and visual design, technological innovation), as well as artistic and cultural studies (anti-authority and anti-war spirits contained in their albums). Especially the zeitgeist and cultural phenomena of the times during the band’s active period (existential anxiety and anti-war spirit generated in the specific historical and political era, etc.).
