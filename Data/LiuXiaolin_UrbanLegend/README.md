## 2. Dataset Introduction

This dataset consists of 100 text entries systematically collected from the "Urban Legends" category on Wikipedia. Each entry contains the unique article ID, the headline/title of the legend, a body text summary, the source URL for verification, and the last revised timestamp.

The characteristics of this dataset reflect the digital documentation of modern folklore, ranging from traditional spooky stories to contemporary internet-based myths. I obtained this data using the `wikipedia-api` in Python, applying a theory-driven decision-making process to ensure the relevance and representative nature of the samples.

**Research Question:** I plan to use this dataset to analyze the linguistic patterns and narrative structures of modern folklore. Specifically, I want to investigate which thematic elements (e.g., technology, paranormal, or health) are most prevalent in English-language urban legends documented in the digital age.
